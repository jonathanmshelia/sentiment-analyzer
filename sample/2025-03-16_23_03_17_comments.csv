Although GLP-1 is not right for me, I have been experiencing insulin resistance lately and I mentioned to my endo that a lot of T1 people are successfully reducing insulin resistance with these medications. He said yes, that‚Äôs true, but there‚Äôs also an increase in deaths because it‚Äôs harder to treat lows. 

These drugs essentially slow down digestion quite a bit, so your food stays in your stomach for a prolonged period of time, rather than moving on to the intestines at a normal pace. For people who are seeking weight loss, this makes them feel full and also sends a signal to the brain that the stomach is full, so they don‚Äôt feel hungry. 

For a T1 approaching or experiencing low blood sugar, this food that‚Äôs parked in the stomach can also slow the absorption of glucose tablets or other treatment so the way you would normally treat a low may not be sufficient.

I‚Äôm not saying that T1s should not take these meds, lots of people seem to be having success with them. I just want to increase awareness about the potential danger for T1 people so we can take care of ourselves and stay safe.

It's not always covered by insurance and a lot of insurers are looking at no longer covering it next year, so be sure to check if cost is a concern for you.

I don't go low any more often than I did before (22 years and never had to use the glucagon).

The amazing quiet I had in my brain the first day after taking it was incredible. I had no idea just how much noise was being created by the constant hunger and amylin deficiency. 
I've been able to drop from about 60 units a day to 30-40 pretty consistently. I can't say my overall levels have changed much or that I experience less highs or lows. 
I've also dropped about 16lbs, so not massive, but I also don't take a big dose.

What I would warn about is I didn't know before starting it that it changes your sensitivity to insulin, so lesson learned. I also had to make changes around my sugar management and exercise and planning that low corrections take longer because your stomach empties slower so any sugar you ingest takes longer to hit. It's not a make or break issue but it's definitely something to be aware of.

I had to go off for 4 months while fighting insurance and my health plummeted. It was pure hell. I went to the gym every day to try to avoid weight gain, I was gaining 3 lbs per week. I do not ever recommend stopping if you decide to start. Do not ever jump to too strong of a dose,  especially if it's out of your system for more than 10 days.  I currently take 1.7 Wegovy.

I have noticed no quality of life decrease in taking it for 2 years. I have noticed **increased** quality of life due to the weight loss and lowered need of insulin. The weight losses have limits as noted by others in the tread.

It‚Äôs been the most effective type 2 med I‚Äôve had so far, I was borderline underweight and despite the side effects because it has helped the cells I have left produce enough insulin and I have successfully gained 10lbs since October when I started..

Metformin is great, still on it, helped get my fasting blood sugar down from 170 to 115 at max dose
