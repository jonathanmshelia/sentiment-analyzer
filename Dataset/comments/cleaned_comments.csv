Ozempic is fantastic for what it was originally designed for: controlling blood sugar. My type 2 diabetes is *severe*, my fasting sugar almost never got below 300/A1C of 14+. My eyesight is shot, I have basically no sensation in my legs from mid-calf on down, and was starting to lose feeling in my hands. My immune system is trash because of it; at one point I was diagnosed with Covid, strep, enterovirus, a double ear infection, and a uti *at the same time*.

Oozempic works by binding to GLP-1 receptors and that stimulates insulin production. Many people, especially those who are Type 2 diabetic, have poor insulin response to eating. 

Ozempic also causes the liver to release less glucose into the bloodstream, so one doesn't need as much insulin. It also dlows down the digestive tract. This action does two things. First, it slows down how quickly the body's blood glucose goes up after eating (meaning one needs less insulin at any one time). Second, the stomach stays full longer, allowing the person to feel full.

Others may not realize that there are other things going on in a person's body other than laziness.

I kinda discounted the Ozempic buzz early on, even as an active person who struggled with weight their whole life.  My MD suggested it and after using it for a while it made me realize a lot of things that I didn't know about myself.

Prior to Ozempic, I had never really been sated with food in my life.   My body has never told me that I had enough and I wasn't really hungry.   If I ate to excess, then I would feel stuffed, but nothing before that.  I thought stuffed an uncomfortable was the stop sign.

Also, I thought about food constantly.  Because my hunger never turned off, I fixated on food and when I was going to eat next and what I was going to have.  It was a 24h a day thing.  Even when I was working out, I was thinking about what I was going to eat.   Ozempic completely turned off that 'food noise'.

It is 100% possible for most mildly obese people to cut their calories, increase their activity and lose weight, but that doesn't mean its going to be 'easy'.   For a lot of people its a constant battle of attrition against their hormones and body.

lph1ryv,topiary566,"I do research in a lab which is looking into semaglutide, which is the generic for Ozempic. This is a bit of a long post, but I would like to give some background on the mechanisms and stuff underlying the drug.

It originally started off as a diabetes medication and it was proven to be effective. Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance where your insulin doesn’t work as well as it should.

Insulin is released in response to high blood sugar after eating. It causes you to store fat (lipogenesis) create glycogen (glycogenesis) produce some ATP to be used immediately for energy (glycolysis) and it also inhibits the opposite of those processes. That way your body stops breaking down fat for energy (lipolysis) stops producing new sugar from other intermediates (gluconeogenesis) and stops breaking down glycogen stores (glycogenolysis). Those specific pathways don’t matter too much, but basically just know that insulin stores energy from blood sugar after you eat. 

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide 1. It is called glucagon like peptide because it has the same precursor mRNA as glucagon before being spliced, but it actually does the opposite of glucagon but that isn’t important) receptor agonist meaning it activates a membrane receptor protein called GLP-1. When GLP is activated, it has a similar effect to insulin. It activates and inhibits the metabolic pathways I mentioned above and it stores blood sugar as energy. Having this protein activated by semaglutide helps reduce blood sugar and other negative effects of insulin resistance. 

The thing about the human body though is that it’s not as simple as having a few pathways which are inhibited and activated. These GLP-1 receptor agonists also do stuff to your brain (I think in the nucleus accumbens but I might be wrong) which will reduce addictive cravings and make you feel full. Studies show it also helps reduce addictive cravings with alcoholism as well. Your body won’t get the same dopamine rush from eating and you’ll stop craving food as much. This is good because diabetes and obesity are often related to each other, and this drug will help tackle both of the problems.

This isn’t to say that it is a miracle drug though. There are a lot of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. I also read somewhere that it is very bad for your thyroid over time. Not to mention, it is a relatively new drug and there aren’t many long term chronic studies with it yet so who knows what it’ll do after decades of use. You need to work with the your primary care doctor or endocrinologist to see if the positive effects of losing weight will outweigh the negative effects of the medication. 

It has been stirring up a crazy lately because a lot of celebrities have been taking ozempic or wegovy and this is making it very popular. They are also advertising the drug hard on TV and stuff. Overall, I feel like this is a great drug and could have a lot of positive effects, but ofc with every medication there are risks and side effects involved.

edit: please do not ask me for medical advice I’m not a doctor lol. I just do research on the drug which involves injecting and gavaging it into mice and look at mechanisms behind it.",1727606371.0,577,t3_1fruy6q,0,577,0

You can work out and eat a high protein diet, but inevitably you will lose muscle mass as you age. Ozempic just adds to that margin of muscle loss.",1739578354.0,364,t1_mctdgga,3,364,0

mctkdvw,DisgruntledPlebian,"Hi! Actual morbidly obese patient taking Wegovy for “weight loss”, have lost 70lbs. It’s saving my life. Allow me to paint you a picture of someone who is addicted to food’s experience with the drug — 

Many who are morbidly obese, myself included, are addicted to food. My childhood involved an abusive father reconciling with us with ice cream, so food became a comfort in the face of a cruel world. It’s easier if you think of it like any other drug — I would be binging a whole pizza and already dreaming of my next fix. You try to diet and exercise, but the siren song of the food noise drowns out every rational thought. While many can hide their vices and addictions, we wear ours on our sleeve (or body).

When I started Wegovy, I was skeptical on what to expect. Of course I had heard all the noise about people wanting it just as a magical skinny shot, but that’s not what I wanted it for — of course I wanted to lose weight, but really I hoped for *something* to help navigate the mine field that was my food addiction, and the results for others were hard to ignore.

After a few weeks, I began to notice something miraculous — I felt full without having binged enough food for 3 people for the first time. I felt FULL, and I was eating an appropriate amount of food. Suddenly, I didn’t feel the urge to eat as much, because I wasn’t always starving. Slowly, I realized that since I didn’t feel the urge to eat as much, the food noise - the constant buzz thinking of food, your next meal, next treat - that has plagued my mind since childhood was GONE. It was like someone had flipped a switch in my mind and whispered “this is what a healthy relationship with food is like”. Suddenly overly processed foods tasted disgusting, the fast food I’d been so addicted to suddenly tasted like the fatty paste it is. It’s been slow steady progress, and it’s not all glamorous. For almost 7 months I had awful nausea, especially the day after my shot, and would randomly need to scuttle off to throw up. Now it’s been almost a year on it, and I only experience the occasional bout of nausea and haven’t thrown up in months. The mental challenges have been the biggest, as food has always been my coping mechanism. How do you cope when you’re coping with losing your coping mechanism?

To ultimately answer your question — it’s because there are a lot of people and celebrities taking it for a “magic fix”, and the general attitude of obese people being weak-willed makes it an easy target for mockery. It doesn’t help at all that these individuals take the medication and supply away from those that
DO need it. All the patients taking it for legitimate reasons are lumped in with them, as in any similar situation.",1739577445.0,333,t3_1ipn8fd,0,333,0

This is not actually what happened, though. Novo Nordisk massively underestimated demand and undershot initial production. My guess is they anticipated a slow adoption because it's an injected medication. I work in the industry and this was a significant concern for every drug company that wanted to get an incretin therapy to market (it's also why the branded injectors are designed as a one use pen rather than a vial or dialable injector like Lantus.) 

The efficacy data was so good, though, that the concerns of ""would J. Random Patient be willing to take an injectable medication at home?"" quickly became a non-issue.

START

The King of Ozempic Is Scared as Hell  
  
Now that Novo Nordisk is the world’s weight-loss juggernaut, will it have to betray its first patients—type 1 diabetics?  
  
ON A FRIGID day in Copenhagen when Erik Hageman was 2 years old, he tripped over his wooden clogs. His face smashed into the floor. In the emergency room, a surgeon repaired his tongue, which had split, but in the months while he was recuperating he shrieked nonstop for water. His urine turned sticky and sweet. The doctor diagnosed diabetes, type 1, the autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own pancreas.  
  
This was 1942. The Nazis occupied Denmark and eugenics was their first medical principle. Trauma like Erik’s fall, some suggested, activated diabetes, and the bloodline of the diabetic was poisoned. Three short weeks of neglect, the doctor promised Hageman’s parents, and their little son would perish of ketoacidosis or starvation. “The best you can do is do nothing,” the doctor said.  
  
Still, Hageman’s parents felt—and this was rebellious, given the master-race ideology that crackled through the Nazi Weltanschauung—that their boy deserved to live. When Hageman’s father, a custodian at a sports college, told his coworkers his son had diabetes, one of them knew a guy.  
  
Hans Christian Hagedorn, short-tempered physician. Wild tufts of hair. At Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium just outside of Copenhagen, he was refining insulin from the pancreases of cows and pigs to make it work better for humans. During a long period under Hagedorn’s care, Erik Hageman started to get twice-daily injections of a fine precipitate of protamine insulin, a breakthrough formulation that prolonged insulin’s effects in the body. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn is still on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. By the time he was 5, Hageman was injecting himself with a wide-gauge needle as broad as—he pantomimed to me, in a kind of diabetic fish story—a tree trunk.  
  
At 85, Erik Hageman is a dapper grandfather of surpassing warmth, compact like a tap dancer. He’s one of the longest-living diabetics in Denmark. We spent an afternoon together in a modernist mansion in Copenhagen called Domus Hagedorn, which is owned by Novo Nordisk, the Danish firm that grew from Hagedorn’s lab. “Hagedorn was rather crazy,” Hageman told me. But without the doctor’s care, he explained, “I’d be blind and I’d have to cut off my legs and have kidney failure.” The now-global company makes half the insulin in the world. Yet today it’s rich and famous for producing Ozempic, the megahit semaglutide drug.  
  
Just before visiting Erik Hageman, I met Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, who has presided over the company’s epochal metamorphosis, at the company’s headquarters in Bagsværd, a suburb of Copenhagen. The building’s design, with its giant helix-like indoor spiral staircase, is inspired by insulin—the molecule, the miracle. In a conference room flooded with light, Jørgensen spoke fondly of Hageman, the company’s poster child. Novo’s executives had clearly presented Hageman to convince me that the company’s greatest achievement is not its stratospheric valuation but its century-long record of saving lives with insulin.  
  
But at Novo these days, semaglutide blocks out the sun. Ozempic was the world’s second-highest-selling drug in 2024. It works extremely well for type 2 diabetes, a non-autoimmune disorder in which the body makes poor use of insulin. And one effect of semaglutide, as we all know now, has been the box-office draw from day one: appetite suppression. The drugs that contain it—especially Ozempic and its more powerful sister Wegovy—have transformed Novo into a global slimming juggernaut. In 2023, the company surpassed Parisian luxury brand LVMH to become the richest company in all of Europe, hitting the ludicrously high market cap of $424 billion. In 2024, Novo took a punch in the face, but it ended the year still richer by market cap than Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Toyota.  
  
Beyond the dazzling before-and-afters, though, Jørgensen is looking at a tricky future, parts of which, he told me, “scare the hell” out of him.  
  
Though Novo has as its controlling shareholder the largest altruistic foundation in the world, it has to act coldly and tactically, like an oil or defense company. The demanding semaglutide business has become a mean ouroboros: the insatiable market, exorbitant manufacturing costs, competition from Eli Lilly, pricing pressure from governments, and the private-insurance dystopia in the US—by far Novo’s biggest market, where some 15 million people now take semaglutide. At the same time is the moral crux. Semaglutide alone almost never works for the 8.4 million type 1 diabetics around the world. What keeps Jørgensen up at night is his fear that, the way drug manufacturing and American health care companies and global markets work, his company might not be able to do right by its original patients. These are the non-Hollywood patients—the ones who, like Eric Hageman, can’t live without insulin.  
  
FOR ITS FIRST 75 years, Novo was indispensable but unknown, a producer of insulin, an anonymous commodity. In 1991 the obscurity started to lift. That year, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a Danish chemical engineer, was seeking a treatment specifically for type 2 diabetes, which accounts for as much as 95 percent of all cases of the disease. Over the next 18 years, she led a Novo team in developing an exquisitely cool medicine for type 2 called liraglutide. Liraglutide is an analogue of a human hormone called GLP-1, for glucagon-like peptide-1. After humans eat, we very, very briefly secrete GLP-1 in the brain stem and the gut.  
  
GLP-1 can be seen as a tranquilizer for the flesh, a soother of deep and primitive longings. GLP-1 says to the body: peace. Food is available. But GLP-1 in its natural form only murmurs these soothing blandishments for a minute or two. It affords the hungry soul a glimpse of OK-ness, but a fleeting one.",1736773487.0,203,t3_1i0cojc,0,203,0

Abstract

Peptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.

Naturally occurring molecule rivals Ozempic in weight loss, sidesteps side effects

A Stanford Medicine study taps artificial intelligence to find a naturally occurring molecule called a peptide that suppressed appetite and led to weight loss in mice and pigs.

A naturally occurring molecule identified by Stanford Medicine researchers appears similar to semaglutide — also known as Ozempic — in suppressing appetite and reducing body weight. Notably, testing in animals also showed that it worked without some of the drug’s side effects such as nausea, constipation and significant loss of muscle mass.

The newly discovered molecule, BRP, acts through a separate but similar metabolic pathway and activates different neurons in the brain — seemingly offering a more targeted approach to body weight reduction.",1741288005.0,174,t3_1j53870,0,174,0

Food addiction is unique in that it must be managed while still consuming the substance you’re overly dependent on for whatever reason.

With other addictions, going cold turkey is often the approach, but with food, that’s not an option. You must learn to manage your addiction instead of stopping.

I see it similarly to how methadone is used for heroin addiction. Ideally, someone will eventually stop using medications like Ozempic, but it serves as a valuable tool to help individuals achieve a healthier state quickly while working through other underlying issues along the way.

As a former ER RN I can say we get a little jaded when we see the worst case scenarios every day and we start to feel these things are “common.”  It’s better if we look at large scale reputable studies. 

So, from chat gpt here’s the run down.

“The incidence of pancreatitis with GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic (semaglutide) or other similar drugs, is generally low, but it has been a noted potential risk. Large clinical trials suggest that the rate of pancreatitis among GLP-1 users is about 0.1% to 0.5%. The risk appears to be relatively rare but is higher in individuals with a history of pancreatitis or other pancreatic conditions.

Several studies have shown no significant difference in pancreatitis risk between GLP-1 receptor agonists and other diabetes treatments, while others have indicated a slight increase. If pancreatitis symptoms (such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) occur, it’s essential to discontinue use and seek medical advice promptly. 

Since pancreatitis risk can vary based on individual health factors, it’s best to discuss with a healthcare provider, especially if there’s any personal or family history of pancreatic conditions.”",1730166136.0,86,t3_1gej69s,0,86,0
m6yvsxk,rharvey8090,"I think this actually comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of obesity medicine. A LOT of obese people have a malfunctioning hormonal response to food, which makes them simply not feel satiated as easily. A lot also don’t eat non stop like the stereotype is. 

Take myself for example. In a fairly normal eater, but I definitely don’t feel full easily, and have almost always been significantly overweight. My wife, on the other hand, eats WAAY more than I do, and is a tiny little thing. To the point it has become a bit of a running joke with her mother’s concern about how little I eat when visiting. 

Now, in the past, I’ve had success losing weight with apps like weight watchers. However, I never would feel like I had eaten enough, so I was basically constantly miserable. As a result, the minute I started militantly tracking my input, I’d start to gain weight back. I’d usually plateau somewhere between 250 and 260 lb, though I don’t really look badly obese (I carry it weirdly, primarily in thighs and butt, so my torso looks fairly normal).

Queue trying out ozempic. The first few weeks, I was careful to supplement my diet with protein powder, because I just felt satiated so easily. I would (and still do) routinely get about half way through a meal, and then just feel full, and put it away. Before id just keep eating until the food was gone, and still feel like I could eat more, which I attenuated by just not making as much. With the ozempic, I can eat a light meal, and feel comfortable until the next one. I have mild side effects like heartburn that are well controlled with omep. I’m down to a weight I haven’t seen since my freshman year of college, and feel amazing. It’s letting me get back into more physical activity, where before I ached and got fatigued far more easily. 

I guess the TL;DR is that GLP-1s are not some “shortcut” necessarily, but something to aid those that have a maldeveloped relationship with food. It helps you have a normal reaction physiologically, and that in turn can help you get to a point where you can physically feel better. Do I think there are those who are just using it irresponsibly? Absolutely, I have skinny coworkers who want to take it to “lose 5 lbs.” but I also think it is an incredibly important medical development for obesity medicine, and overall population health.",1736796035.0,86,t1_m6yl72r,1,86,0

""In a randomized trial, time-restricted eating did not enhance the effect of calorie restriction on weight loss.

Time-restricted eating (i.e., confining calorie intake to a limited period of each day) leads to weight loss in animals, possibly because calories are consumed only during metabolically active periods. Human studies have shown weight loss benefits with time-restricted eating (e.g., [NEJM JW Gen Med Oct 1 2022](https://www.jwatch.org/na55229) and *JAMA Intern Med* 2022 182:953) but have not consistently controlled for total calorie intake.

Investigators addressed this issue with a randomized, controlled trial in which 41 adults (mean age, 59) with obesity (mean weight, 99 kg) and prediabetes or diet-controlled diabetes received isocaloric diets with equivalent micro- and macronutrient composition; calorie amounts were based on metabolic needs and activity levels. Food was prepared in a study kitchen and consumed onsite or taken home. The intervention group was instructed to eat between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and to consume 80% of calories by 1 p.m. The control group was instructed to eat between 8 a.m. and midnight, with 55% of calories after 5 p.m.

What more recent science shows us (not just ozempic and related drug studies) is that it's vastly more complicated than that. Genetics and epigenetics are in play. Chronic illness isn't just a result of obesity, but sometimes a cause of obesity. Lifesaving medications can cause obesity. Things we are just starting to understand in the brain cause obesity.

Drugs like ozempic came on the market for diabetes and all of a sudden we saw that it helped people with all kinds of conditions losing weight. Then it got approved for obesity without diabetes, and shit, it worked there too. And now, another unexpected thing - it seems to help alcoholics quit drinking. 

What society hasn't caught up with yet is that maybe something else has been going on, and maybe there is a treatment for it. Which means maybe there is a cause other than ""that guy won't stop eating, we should shame him.""

The reality is that guidelines and prescribing trends have changed and a huge portion of the diabetic population is now taking these medications.

It's magical, but not in the way you seem to have believed. It allows you to easily sucessfully diet, but it won't keep you from over eating or boredom eating. It just completely removes all hormonal incentives to do so and gets rid of the first month of dieting side effects (constant hunger, heart burn, etc).

It took about 4 months for my stomach to shrink and for me to normalize the new portion sizes. I didn't lose the ability to enjoy food, or hunger in general. I feel very hungry before meals still, I just feel uncomfortably full now with about 1/3rd of what I ate in the past, and my appetite for more food is gone completely instead of extended after the meal, like it used to.

It won't work if you don't diet. But as someone who dieted religiously for years and never reached this weight, even with total fasting. It seems almost magically unfair, unfair that a single hormone had so much control over what I ate.

edit: I went from high in obese to merely overweight. Lost about 8 milk jugs full of fat, an amount I can't even comprehend having to carry around now.

luw0stu,Prince_Marf,"&gt;I want to ask you, why not just address the issue at hand, which is your eating habits? What are you afraid of I. Answering that?

Because I have been addressing the issue at hand for decades at this point. Do you think nobody has told me diet and exercise are the key to healthy weight loss? Do you think I've never joined a gym? I've paid nutritionists, doctors, used diet tracking apps, tried meal kits, tried keto, tried weight watchers, watched podcasts... it goes on and on.

Two things have shown moderate results:

(1) living in Japan on a 4 month exchange trip. Didn't have a car or access to fast food. Ate a bunch of sushi and cheap snacks but portion sizes are small. I would have to *try* not to lose weight when I lived there. Sadly there is no way my career will ever take me back there. I am a lawyer trained in U.S. law so there is little opportunity for me in other countries, and there would be a lot of downsides to living in Japan long term anyway.

(2) Taking Adderall for ADHD. Stimulants cut appetite when you first go on them, and they give you a bunch of energy. It was great. I was actually able to exercise and focused on eating healthier not just less. Lost a bunch of weight and finally felt like I had control. Of course this effect wears off over time. But it helped me feel better about my body. The weight returned but the body positivity stayed. 

These two experiences combined, showed me that the only way to achieve meaningful weight loss (at least for me) is a change in my material conditions. I will never willpower my way to the body I want. Something has to happen that eliminates my access to unhealthy food and forces me to move my body. I will never be able to make these daily choices on my own. I need to put myself in circumstances where losing weight is easy.",1730482418.0,51,t1_luvsmja,1,51,0

 I just wanted to put the information out there so the people who want to know (like me) can see what the paper in question is *actually* about.

 Especially since we kind of already know that if you consume the same amount of calories weight loss will stop once your calorie intake matches your expenditure. Or at least it should with the assumption that bodies are mathematically perfect. (For example, a 5’5” sedentary woman at 180lbs will maintain weight with ~1850kcal. If she were to go on a diet of let’s say 1600kcal, we would expect her to plateau at  ~140lbs because that’s the amount of calories a 5’5” sedentary woman would need to maintain 140lbs.) 

Slightly disappointed the paper isn’t actually about that because it would be neat to get more information what exactly causes the discrepancies between expected vs actual energy needs as most of what I’ve seen has amounted to “it’s a lot of things” (like accuracy of measuring, people’s perception of how much they ate, accuracy of gym equipment, biological difference like some people just being better at conserving energy by being less active/fidgety than their counterparts, different fat compositions, different overall body compositions, fetal environment, etc. etc.), but not a whole lot of concrete cellular mechanisms.",1741590626.0,40,t1_mgx5r0o,2,40,0

I never went back to maintenance calories during the 2 years or so it took me to do that.  Personally, the biggest problem I have seen with people, and weight loss, is they want it to happen far too quickly.   So they do a deficit that is much too large to sustain over the long run.   It is possible that with Ozempic the same thing is happening especially if you were very big to begin with.   They will see much larger loss initially from water weight, reconfiguration and then expect that the weight will continue to come off at that speed.   So they push far too hard.   In my experience weight never comes off in a linear manner on a scale.  Fat loss at 500 calorie deficit will be 1 pound a week but water weight and other things will shift far quicker than that.   So it is easily masked by other changes.   So people see a 1 or 2 week hold at a specific weight and think they are not losing when it just takes time for that to continue to be registered on a scale.",1741607040.0,38,t1_mgy09fw,2,38,0

Those systems getting out of whack might partly be responsible for obesity by telling people’s bodies to store too many calories as fat and Ozempic might be helping right the ship.

m0psbs1,Dr_Mike_Herring,"Ohhhh this is my wheelhouse!

GLP-1 medications do a LOT, but alter your metabolism actually isn't one of the things it does! Here are a few ways it works (there are actually a lot):

GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that gets released by the intestine usually about 15 minutes after starting a meal to signal the stomach and brain 'cool, that's enough.'

In the stomach, it actually slows your stomachs ability to process the food and send it to your small intestine. You feel full, faster because your stomach empties itself much slower. This is one of the reasons some people get really bad nausea when they first start these medications-because they eat super quickly. The slower you eat each meal, the less likely you are to experience nausea due to the actual volume of food. If you eat super fast, your stomach goes from 'comfortable' to 'HOLY CRAP' (think: super stretched) very quickly.

In the brain, that signal is essentially mimicking ""I've eaten enough"" which is viewed as limiting cravings, eliminating food noise, etc. Unfortunately, some people's brains are VERY sensitive to this signal, which can cause nausea without your stomach being stretched. Really sucks for this subset of the population, but it generally improves with time.

Instead of GLP-1 medications changing your metabolism (which is more of an old wives tale than anything), it actually mimics your bodys natural response to being appropriately satiated, causing you to have fewer cravings, fewer instances of 'eating because you're bored' and helps you eat quite a bit less.

It does plenty of other things for diabetes management not associated with eating less as well as for heart health, but that's the basis of why people on these medications eat less.

There are a lot more things GLP-1 does and I made a little graphic that I'll add to this response-it's a bit over-simplified but can give you a better understanding of everything it can do-I'll add it to this post.

Hope this helps!

The warning with regards to thyroid cancer exists because rats given GLP-1 agonists (like Ozempic) have elevated risks of thyroid cancer. However, the pathway by which that affects rats doesn’t seem to exist in primates, including most humans, barring a small number of people with unusual genetics. We don’t have the proper types of receptors in our thyroid cells to be affected by GLP-1 agonists there in that way. As for pancreatitis, it’s a side effect of weight loss itself, with or without Ozempic. It’s similar to how gallstones are a concern for people on GLP-1 agonists - it’s not the drugs creating the problem directly, it’s that the drugs are causing weigh loss, which creates the problem.",1702786570.0,33,t1_kdp39qd,6,33,0

OP says it's fun to watch, however, I think it's a slippery slope. In my experience, most people do not know what a significant blood sugar spike is nor understand postprandial responses in general. So it starts to create disordered eating that can result in extreme cutting, or fear of blood sugar rising at all.

I work in food science to an extent, and the level of misinformation about blood sugar scares me. It's currently being pushed as such an extreme thing, some people can spike about 10 points when they wake up from like a fasted 70 to an 80 and genuinely believe they have ""hurt themselves."" To make matters worse, the monitor is generally 10-20 points off at any time which is NBD for diabetics (as often if their sugars are 200+, being slightly off is still valuable AF to know) and it can depend on where you wear it so if you sleep on it you'll get a higher reading.

I have had a serious issue with overeating for as long as I can remember; I practically live to eat and have gone through several professionally curated diet and exercise regimes throughout my life. It makes me feel like shit to say but I even got gastric bypass surgery, lost a ton of weight and put it back on within 2 years after COVID hit and depression rammed me like a dump truck, resorting to eating to cope.

Since I started on Ozempic, the amount of food I'm eating daily has more than halved. I eat a big breakfast and it can keep me going till dinnertime with maybe a small snack in between, and a small snack late at night. Before I'd eat 3 meals a day and several snacks in between meals.

The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I'm constantly more or less full, and my doctor said I need to make sure I remind myself to eat so I don't go to the extremes, which I thought would be easy but it really isn't. I have to make sure I remind myself to eat enough to keep me going, and honestly while I'm getting used to the new normal I feel quite a bit weaker. I'm a really big guy so eating this little takes getting used to, but honestly, I don't mind.

I  started with a quarter dose for 4 weeks, then I get half-dose for another 4 weeks, then eventually a full dose ongoing until I stop. The side effects have been minimal for me luckily with only a bit of nausea and a bit of diarrhoea but it's not too bad.

Honestly, I feel like the people most outspoken against it are the kinds of people that believe that if you want to lose weight you should suffer and deal with doing it the ""traditional"" way.

k0kpwh0,artificial_l33tener,"Hi!  I was not part of this study, but as a T1 diagnosed ~3 years ago, I was prescribed Ozempic to prolong my honeymoon and am happy to share my journey.

When first diagnosed, I was able to take a fairly small amount of basal insulin per day (6-8 units of Tresiba), with no fast acting insulin.  I also largely removed sugar from my diet, and limited carbs to roughly 30-45g per meal, and used a cgm to generally plan my food around my sugar.

This worked quite well for nearly a year, though with steadily increasing basal doses.  Eventually things got to a point where my post prandial spikes were taking too long to come down (over an hour above 180 on a lowish carb meal) and I asked my provider about MDI or a pump.  I was on roughly 18 units of Tresiba at this point, and also had a fast acting for ""just in case"" times or if I wanted to indulge in some more substantial carbs.

At this time, she recommended trying a small dose of Ozempic to see if we could extend my honeymoon.  I very gradually moved up to .25 mg, and had a significant response to the medication.  I was able to move back down to 6-8 units of Tresiba in normal circumstances, and in times when I was exercising significantly (ie, a beach vacation with lots of walking and swimming) I went off insulin entirely since I was getting so many lows.  I had normal Ozempic side effects (digestive issues) but they were pretty mild.

I continued forward at .25 of Ozempic and slowly increasing doses of basal insulin for another ~3 months or so.  Then we again began to see post prandial spikes beyond what my Endo and I were comfortable with, so I moved to .5 mg of Ozempic.  Similar results to last time, this time with another 6-9 months passing before needing to up my Ozempic dose.

Finally, we moved to a full 1 mg of Ozempic.  In terms of control, it was fantastic.  My sugar was great, and I was again on a fairly small basal dose of insulin.  However at this point even after 2-3 months of trying to acclimate my body the side effects were just too much for me.  I spent a good deal of time being nauseous, avoiding eating much food, and generally feeling miserable.

At this point we moved back my Ozempic dose to .5 mg, and upped my basal to 16 units of Tresiba.  This sort of worked but post prandial spikes were still getting a little high for comfort, even after turning up the basal to 22 units.  I was also having a fairly high basal rate, with blood sugars below 120 feeling uncomfortable for me.

At this point I began doing a very mild form of MDI when I knew a challenging food was coming up.  I was very hesitant, as the few times I used fast acting insulin with Ozempic, even in extremely low doses, it drove me to some fairly scary lows.  However in very small doses this worked, giving me 85%+ time in target on my cgm and generally getting basal and post prandial blood sugar into a more comfortable range.

This brings us to my current state.  After discussing with my Endo, she was comfortable with me to stick with the previous regimen, but I decided to move towards a pump.  If I'm already doing multiple doses of insulin a day I don't view the side effects of Ozempic as worth it.  I'm also highly interested in moving to an open source looping solution (Android APS), which she was aware of and comfortable with me exploring based on a history of good control and my background in tech.

I am currently in week 3 post Ozempic, full MDI trying to nail down what my constants for an insulin pump would be, and will be switching to an Omnipod Dash paired with a Dexcom via Android APS in the near future.

Overall, I'd certainly recommend talking to your Endo about Ozempic or other semaglutide medication if you are recently diagnosed and still have some pancreas functionality.  I can't speak to any long term benefits, but it helped me extend my honeymoon period, which offered significant mental health benefits as I eased into the life of a T1D a little more gradually.  I also believe the ability to have more time to learn how certain foods and activities affect my blood sugar, and just the general vocabulary and working knowledge of being a diabetic likely means I've had better control in these first few years than I would've otherwise.

I have slowly been re-introducing carbs back into my diet. My main daily goal is still low carb, but I don’t feel bad indulging in carbs every once in a while and my blood sugars have remained low. For example, last night we went out for date night where I had a steak and we shared a baked potato. My blood sugar was 94 after 👍. My biggest struggle is that my doctor refuses to prescribe me a CGM so I’m going to have to buy one myself. I know I don’t need it, but I would really like to see how my body reacts to different foods at least for a couple of months. I was up to 1mg Ozempic dose for 3 months. Recently, I actually had 2 instances of hypoglycemia which I didn’t enjoy, so I cut back my dose to 0.75mg the last 2 weeks. I feel like I may even cut back to 0.5mg next week because I’ve had readings in the 60s AFTER a meal. I don’t want to experience hypoglycemia again, but I also want to maintain tight control of hyperglycemia so I’ve just got to balance it out.

&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide (Ozempic), have been observed to influence dopamine-related behaviors, particularly those associated with reward and addiction.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125000221

From the linked article: 

SDU researchers have discovered a new way in which the liver regulates its consumption of sugar and fat. This could potentially increase the effectiveness of weight-loss and diabetes medication.

Many people who have tried to lose weight by cutting calories are familiar with this frustrating reality: at some point, the body stops shedding pounds. It senses the reduced calorie intake and responds by slowing down metabolism, causing it to burn fewer calories than before the diet.

This happens because the body perceives a potential starvation threat and adapts by conserving energy while still carrying out essential functions.

It may seem incredibly unfair that the body doesn’t recognize the goal of weight loss and instead works against it by holding on to calories.

Now, a new Danish study has identified a possible way to maintain calorie burning even when consuming fewer calories. This discovery could be particularly important for patients using weight-loss or diabetes medicines like Wegovy and Ozempic. Many people taking these medications find that their weight loss plateaus after losing about 20-25% of their body weight.

According to Kim Ravnskjaer, a Principal Investigator and associate professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, this stall is likely due to the body's natural response.

It usually goes well at first, but as people lose some of the weight they aim to shed, their progress stalls because the body’s metabolism adapts, he says.

If it were possible to control this metabolic adaptation, it could be a game-changer for anyone trying to lose weight. A medication that could counteract this effect might extend the benefits of treatments like Wegovy, which often stop working after a certain point. This is where the new study by Kim Ravnskjaer and colleagues— published in the prestigious journal Cell Metabolism —comes into play.

If we could develop a medication that helps maintain fat or sugar burning at its original high level alongside weight-loss treatments, people could continue losing weight beyond the usual plateau, he explains.

The researchers' discovery was unexpected when they were investigating the function of a gene called Plvap in certain liver cells in mice. The team knew from previous studies that humans born without this gene have problems with their lipid metabolism, a connection the research team set out to investigate.

It turned out that the Plvap gene enables the body’s metabolic shift from burning sugar to fat when fasting. And when Plvap is turned off – as the researchers did in their laboratory mice – the liver does not recognize that the body is fasting and continues burning sugar.",1741551718.0,27,t3_1j7gn3a,0,27,0

That's 1.5-2.2g/kg, which is [useful but not necessary](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/protein-science/).

That article goes over several of the recent meta-analyses in significant detail; I would summarize it with this quote:  
&gt;&gt; ""if you increase your protein intake from 1.0 to 1.5g/kg, you’ll probably get a pretty big payoff. Further increasing your protein intake from 1.5 to 2.0g/kg would likely still yield benefits, but the benefits would be quite a bit smaller. Further increases above 2.0g/kg may still yield some additional benefits, but the additional gains will be smaller yet.""

And that's for people wanting to maximize muscle growth.

0.7g/lb of bodyweight -- 105g for our hypothetical 150 lb person -- is fine for normal people wanting to gain some muscle or avoid losing it while losing weight but who are not otherwise heavily optimizing the process.  1g/lb is also good, but not necessary.",1741312868.0,24,t1_mgfgzs8,4,24,0

I pay out of pocket because the cost is less than I would spend on food each month, and the benefits are many. On day one I realized that a very loud voice in my head always thinking about food — that’s been there my whole life and that I wasn’t even aware of — was gone.  It was incredible.

People say, “once you start taking it, you’ll have to take it the rest of your life, or the weight will come back on.” Well I f I don’t take it I will get diabetes and have to give myself multiple shots every day, not to mention a whole bunch of diabetes side effects. That’s a no-brainer to me.

He has to jump through hoops to get his medication covered by insurance because it’s been prescribed for weight loss in the past (it’s not one of the main ones like Ozempic, but it can help a person lose significant weight and is also used for diabetes).  

At the same time, he doesn’t lose weight while on it. People who use Ozempic and aren’t suffering from the metabolic issues that cause obesity that the drug corrects don’t lose weight while on it. It actually seems to be a cure for obesity for many people because it treats the cause of obesity for those people. 

I don’t consider that cheating. A lot of people do, and they’re upset that “lazy” people don’t have to “put in the work.” Others are upset because it drives up the price of the drugs for people who need it (people in heart failure and diabetics) and causes shortages. 

I don’t think we should be blaming individuals for this, however.

I lost 60 pounds over the course of a year on ozempic but used it as a springboard to develop healthy habits for when I got off of it. It suppressed your desire for sugar so I ended up getting rid of all my unhealthy sweet snacks, replacing them with fruits and vegetables. I’ve kept that up, haven’t gone back to buying junk snacks. I wasn’t working out due to my weight but as I started losing it, I made myself exercise and now I exercise about 5 times a week on average. I learned portion control, smaller plates at home and when I go out to eat I rarely finish my entire meal because restaurants really do serve too much carbs. Also as I was getting off the drug, we lowered the dose over the last month and a half so I didn’t jump from full appetite suppression to suddenly having none.

I did gain back around 5 pounds after getting off the drug and my weight fluctuates +-3 pounds nowadays but I’ve kept most of the weight from coming back and it’s been months since I stopped.

40% of society is obese, 75% are overweight. Many people who are prediabetes or no diabetes would see benefits of glucaphage on a number of body systems because glucose management is so critical. GLP-1 meds are a game changer that very few people will have contraindications for taking. Lots of people would be better off getting results without assistance with proper diet and exercise, but they aren’t. This med is a game changer. Society needs this. 

Only other med that might be good too would be uncoupled phosphorylation medications. These have low therapeutic windows, so companies are working on compounds to make them safer for use without as much risk for cases of abuse.

Biggest risk to either type of medication is muscle wasting from aggressive weight loss. This happens when people don’t do resistance training and are in a large calorie deficit, especially below their BMR. If someone does resistance training 2-3 days/week to create muscle demand and eats at their BMR and gets exercise then muscle loss will be a minimum.

What's the difference between that and regular dieting? According to MichiganMedicine.Org (https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/weighing-facts-tough-truth-about-weight-loss) over 90% of people who go on a diet regain all their weight.

Diabetes affects the pancreas. Yes, even in T2. A T2 pancreas will be stressed out and constantly kicking out insulin, and a T1 pancreas has been attacked by the immune system. So, is it a big shock that the risks listed involve the pancreas? Not really. It’s the primary organ affected (yes, yes, it’s an autoimmune disease, but the target organ here is the pancreas).

Years ago I decided I was going to get into the best shape possible whether I managed to lose weight or not. I've been at it 6 years. I make sure I get enough vitamins and minerals and my nutrition is pretty good - except I eat too much junk food.

I think about food (usually sugar foods) pretty much all day, every day. I don't know own how to stop. I've done diets, therapy, hypnotism, diet pills (prescription and non prescription), supplements etc. Everything you can think of except the pill that makes you shit out fat and actual surgery.

When I started working out I went down from. 350lbs to 285 and I've been stuck there ever since.

I'm in the process of trying to get ozempic. I'm not really sure what else to do. I try not to give into my cravings - and i don't 99% of the time. But until I can get that to 99.999% it won't be enough. I just want to stop being obsessed with food and I hope ozempic can help me.

For the record for the past 6 years (and the past 3 extremely consistently) i strength train 5x a week. I do yoga once a week and I do cardio 4 to 6 times a week. And I've seen massive improvements.

A surprising (to me) amount of people still want to congratulate me on the weight loss, and I know they mean well, because it’s so ingrained in my generation and older that weight loss = good, no matter how it comes about, but I’m so over it. I’m always like, *My guy, this is not my doing. I tried and failed to lose weight for the last 35 years.

Neither has been under my control.

I am embarrassed about most facets of my diabetes, because it’s completely out of my control and nobody can figure out why. The cancer doesn’t help, but that’s only been the last couple years, and I’ve never had good control over the diabetes. I eat like I’m supposed to, I walk everywhere because I don’t drive, I’ve lost 80lbs, I’ve taken maybe nine or ten different combinations of meds, and they all improve things for a few weeks to a few months and then my sugars gradually start creeping up again. I’ve had the tests and I’m definitely not a misdiagnosed type 1. So I blame myself. I have poorer control of this illness than most of the teenagers I know, and that’s embarrassing.

kdom69g,[deleted],"Part of the reason it works so well on weight is *because* it's a diabetes drug. Insulin has been used off label for weight loss in extreme cases for years. When your cells are insulin resistant (which 70% of obese individuals are, even without diabetes), it promotes a feedback loop that makes losing weight harder. Ozempic (all your GLP-1s really) has the benefit of making it easier for cells to use insulin and interrupt the feedback loop. This can be seen in very modest effects even with Metformin with \~5% weight loss vs \~15% with Ozempic. So it's a real double whammy. It reduces appetite because of the slowed gastric emptying and interrupts the insulin resistance/weight gain feedback loop.

My symptoms seemed to mellow but didn't go away. So I asked him if that meant it had caused my symptoms ""no way to be sure but if you feel better without it and you don't need to take it it's probably best to stay off it.""

Anyways over the next year or 2 I was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. They still aren't sure which. My consultant still isn't sure if the meds I was on were exacerbating my illness or if that was just a flare up. I've had similar flare ups since while not taking the meds but that particular flare up really seemed to begin and end with taking that medication.

My point is a proper doctor will be very cautious to state anything with absolute certainty unless there is absolute certainty. And I don't think what the OP describes is a situation with absolute certainty.

That being said Ozempic is a relatively new drug and is being used in a new way. We should all be diligent about monitoring our health and reaction to the drug. I've seen credible research that it may lead to increased risk of certain bowel cancers and anecdotally there seems to be some people that just have far more severe side effects.

But as my GP said to me ""there were far more things you were at risk of dying from when you weighed 120lbs more"" and the types of cancers I may be more at risk of now are easily detectable by a blood test. So part of my regime now is to have regular blood tests and check ups with my GP.",1730207958.0,17,t1_luat912,2,17,0

You could show him articles written by healthcare providers on why it's important to maintain a healthy diet on ozempic.

One of the worse case scenarios is him getting hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis, which is highly likely with those blood sugar levels. So you could also show him a list of early signs/symptoms of DKA, so he has the knowledge to call 911 or go to the ER immediately if any symptoms start occurring (e.g., labored breathing, nausea or vomiting).

Get his doctor or someone he trusts or respects (eg a friend) to talk to him.

Has he always ate like this? I wonder if he is using food as a coping mechanism for something here. Fried foods and sweets are quick ways to release endorphins.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-now-with-trevor-noah/id1710609544?i=1000682368570

The most interesting parts of this conversation were: 
 
1. People on these medications who suffer with overeating tend to have other addictive behaviors as well: social media, gambling, shopping, drinking.  Some reported that when their appetites were curbed by these medications, they found their other addictive behaviors curbed as well. 

2. Some in our society are quick to shame those who are overweight—as opposed to the food deserts and addictive foods (chips, soda, candy, fast food, etc) that actively FEED those addictions. Added to that, because being overweight has a visual stigma attached to it, people can SEE their addiction and they are more likely to be stigmatized because of it (more so than someone else who might have a gambling or shopping addiction, for instance, that is not as surface level/noticeable). 

3. Body positivity vs. body shaming. These patients walk such a fine line—they feel as though society hates them for being overweight, but then the FEW people who actually supported their body positivity turn on them if they DO lose weight.  They literally are in a catch 22–and in almost all instances, it’s not out of a concern for their health, but unrealistic beauty standards (that now we ALL face thanks to filters and AI).  

It’s a hard topic, but informed consent and shared decision making is always my go-to, clinically speaking (I don’t actually prescribe these meds myself, just for clarification—I’m in Urgent Care and have no way to monitor them.

If you wish to lose weight, you ""just"" need to eat less. If you also eat healthy, it's a lot easier to eat less (calorie wise), since healthy food makes you feel full, while junk food doesn't the same way. 

A good way can be to either buy smaller plates, eat slower, or just eating 10% less thsn you currently do (assuming you're not currently gaining weight).

Junk food doesn't give the right nutrients either, which might make it easier for you to feel like shit if you're also eating less than normal. A healthy diet shouldn't make you feel like shit, even in a calorie deficit (unless you are addicted to sugar, which most people are honestly, but the withdrawals goes away in a week or two).

The overlooked issue here and likely in the studies you reference (but don't actually cite) are gaps in awareness/precision of measurement. 

Sure, you think you're logging all the food and your apple watch is saying you burned 900 calories in your workout, but these estimates have a large degree of inaccuracy. 

CICO only falls flat when carried out without actual awareness of intake and expenditure. 

Every time we study CICO in lab/metabolic wards (food controlled, energy intake /output controlled for) we see very predictable weight gain and loss. 

There is no getting around thermodynamics, with or without medication. 

Here is an example of as precise measurement as currently possible demonstrating that insulin/blood glucose isn't a significant issue in weight loss, and a calorie is in fact a calorie. Dr. Hall's lab is considered the gold standard in human nutrition research.

In non overweight diabetics I’ve observed adverse effects like unintentional weight loss and hypoglycemia unawareness, when glucose control could be effectively achieved with a much milder medication like Trulicity (dulaglutide) that does not cause weight loss. 

Meanwhile, nearly all patients prescribed these medications for obesity have experienced significant overall improvements in their health, such as better cholesterol levels, blood pressure, joint relief, cardiovascular health, and obstructive sleep apnea—REAL and serious comorbid conditions which accompany obesity and take years off your life.

Metformin, which is now a staple medication for Type 2 diabetes, was originally developed for *influenza* treatment. Pharmaceutical drugs can often found to be more effective for conditions different than their original purpose.

OP, I think ozempic is fine, but this attitude is why you are 350lbs. You do not need to lose weight to go out and try sports. You mentioned that you have not been a healthy weight since before puberty, so I will go out on a limb and assume that you have not been very physically active in that time frame. 

My thoughts on this are that instead of relying on a drug, you should go out and try those sports you've wanted to try as you are. If you find something you enjoy and stick with it, you *will* become healthier. If you wait until you lose weight before you try something new, who's to say you will actually try it once you reach your weight goals?

When I worked ICU, we had a lot of complicated patients from this one GI surgeon.

I saw a lot more ICU patients from him than anyone else in his specialty. I subconsciously developed a negative opinion of the guy. 

Eventually I learned that he was considered by far the best in the city. The reason I kept seeing complications was that he took on patients who were complicated or high risk before the procedure. Other surgeons didn't have the same issues because they would not even touch the high risk patients. So again it was a skewed sample.

We know willpower is limited. It takes work and mental energy to eat less. However, there is a drug that makes it such that it requires no willpower at all to eat less.

This gives you so much more “willpower bandwidth” to do other things in your life. You can paint, you can learn an instrument, you can parent your kids, you can create shareholder value. Hell, you can even more effectively change your diet composition since you are not as tied to the amount of food you consume.

Why is it that, when an obese person who does not want to dispense that willpower on dieting and would rather use it on things they enjoy, it is a moral failure on their part? Who cares if it’s a “shortcut”, who cares if it skips the part that requires work, who cares if you didn’t learn anything?

These habits stay when you get off the medication.

Most people that use these medications do so because they’re drastically at rock bottom and just getting up and creating a routine of eating extremely healthy and working out post 30 has extremely low returns, causing people more often than not to quit.

I have a familial history of high cholesterol and after losing 70 lbs, my high LDL and Total numbers didn’t change a single point. So lifestyle changes didn’t affect my cholesterol. But guess what?

It really helped with boredom eating and overeating, to the point where I can no longer eat a normal (American) restaurant sized portion of food, so I get a box pretty much every time we go out.

During that first year, you need to gradually increase the dosage so that it continues to be effective. You still need to try and eat more healthy and exercise. I hate going to the gym, but during spring/summer/fall I have plenty of outdoor activities I like more.

I have struggled a bit with loss of muscle mass, but do quite a bit of exercise to help with that. I have had a couple of times during really strenuous mountain bike rides where I've almost passed out due to low blood sugar, almost certainly due to my liver not releasing enough glucose.

I think given the obesity epidemic in the US, there's a very good argument for part of the population to take Ozempic as part of their fitness/wellness journey. The problem I'm seeing is that as it's become mainstream to take ozempic, the Uber-skinny (heroin chic) look has returned as a beauty standard. People who would otherwise be considered healthy weight buckle under these new standards and want to become even skinnier. I have two acquaintances who were so concerned about being a couple pounds above ideal bmi that they started taking ozempic. Now they're under their target weight and so afraid of gaining those few extra pounds that they're considering taking ozempic indefinitely. Our new societal standard, driven in part by ozempic, is reviving the mental health crisis from a few decades back.

So while I agree there's a definite need for this drug in a certain portion of the population, I'm concerned about the spillover effect on the opposite end of the spectrum: folks who are already a healthy weight becoming ultra focused on being skinnier as that unhealthy beauty standard returns.",1730485805.0,12,t3_1gh8oh6,0,12,0

lia6tnn,SparksAndSpyro,"Unfortunately, you won't be able to provide a study that supports that particular assertion. At bottom, Calories In vs Calories Out is the controlling principle of weight loss. It is not negotiable or arguable. It derives from the laws of thermodynamics. So unless someone can literally break the laws of physics, they will have to contend with CICO.

Of course, the nuance is the ""in"" and ""out"" pieces. Not every calorie you eat is absorbed into your body. Although the body is pretty efficient at absorbing energy from food, people absorb (i.e., take in) different amount of calories depending on genetics, environmental factors, health factors, time of day, blood sugar levels (as you mentioned), etc. for the same food ingested. Moreover, people burn (i.e., take out) different amounts of calories for the same activities based on height, weight, genetics, metabolism, etc. All of this is uncontroversial.

**BUT** that does not mean that CICO is useless. Quite the opposite, in fact: counting calories from your food will literally provide the *upper* limit of your intake because calorie information is based on an assumption of 100% absorption (i.e., how much energy is in the food, not how much you *absorb*). So, if you ""ate"" 2000 calories, that is the **most** you could have absorbed. It goes without saying that you cannot absorb more than 100% of the energy available in food (again, thermodynamics).

To sum up, if you calculate your total calorie expenditure within a reasonable degree of accuracy, track your calories, and *consistently* eat less calories than your daily expenditure, you **will** lose weight. If you do not, then it is because you either (1) are not tracking your calories ""eaten"" (not absorbed) properly or (2) your estimate of calorie expenditure is significantly off and should be reduced. It's as simple as that. No one can break the laws of physics.

Accordingly, the speed of weight loss is simply determined by the deficit between calories burned vs calories absorbed. If people lose weight faster on ozempic, it is because they eat/absorb less calories than people not on ozempic. The slower digestion and blood sugar mediation may effect that through appetite suppression, but they do not, directly, cause weight loss. Anything else that suppresses appetite (or simply not eating through willpower) will produce the same weight loss, *all else being equal* (this is the big caveat, since people on Ozempic are obviously more likely to stick to a diet plan more easily than someone attempting to lose weight through willpower alone).",1723747561.0,11,t1_li9elle,2,11,0

Can you describe another addiction that is quite literally required by the human body on a base level to survive? Imagine trying to ween off cigarettes, but you have to smoke a pack a day to not starve to death.

&gt; millions of people on ozempic forever

I don’t see the problem in this whatsoever.

&gt; Why not just rip off the band-aid and do it right from the start. 

Would you say something similar to those with diabetes? What about Parkinson’s? Parkinson’s is manageable without sinemet, but no one is telling those with Parkinson’s that they should rip off the band aid and learn to treat their disease without medication.

&gt; moral failing

I don’t think you believe that obesity is a moral failing, but I am generalizing society’s negative stigma with being fat. I believe that if one believes obesity is “controllable”, then one tends to moralize obesity. When one moralizes obesity then they tend to believe less often that obesity is a disease.

Differences in GLPT-1 expression and response are fundamental to the hunger/satiety complex.  Adjusting that response through something like ozempic  treats the underlying dysfunction at the root of insulin resistance, diabetes, and dysregulated hunger from the stomach to the brain.

The chain I work at currently has pretty much no issue getting doses of wegovy/zepbound/mounjaro within a day. Sometimes the lowest dosages could take a few, but that has barely been an issue for the last 6 months.  




A member of my household has to use a different pharmacy as mine is not contracted with their insurance. The chain they go to, 3 miles away, has a much larger issue with obtaining it. (This also leads to dumb things like one chain charging $20 for a script and another $300. The more expensive one probably isn't contracted with the manufacturer who makes the cheaper versions.)




Pharmacy size also impacts it. Stores get placed in ""tiers"" based on how busy they are. Higher the tier, the more volume you have, so you get more medications allocated to your store. Our sister store 5 miles away is physically unable to order as much of those meds as I can, as they are two tiers lower. This then comes down to the actual manager of the pharmacy and what they feel like doing. 






Just a little info dump on how some of this stuff works. Might be on backorder for CVS, but Walgreens has a huge supply left. Could be that a smaller pharmacy just can't order enough to keep up with demand on a 1 or 2 day fill basis. We have a few regulars who fill all their medications at their preferred pharmacy, except for their GLP's.

That is exactly what Ozempic did for me. I hope it will give you the same freedom. 

I didn't learn until my mid thirties that I have insulin resistance, and that was causing the insane hunger. I would get miserable physical symptoms that mimicked low blood sugar if I was under 1800 calories for the day. Fast food and simple carbs were quick ways to stop those symptoms. If I tried to eat less, I'd eventually get so distressed that I'd end up binging. 

It is honestly amazing to live without that persistent ""feed me feed me feed me"" drumbeat in my head. People who have never experienced this have no idea how lucky they are.

luvucyp,Prince_Marf,"I agree obesity is both a personal failure and a policy failure, but I lean *heavily* toward it being a policy failure. I actually did a study abroad in Japan for 4 months in college and lost like 20lb without even trying. I didn't need a car because the trains are so good so I did a lot of walking, even if it was just to and from the train station. There was also very little fast food, and even when there was the portion sizes were much smaller. Fresh seafood is very common and cheap in Japan so that naturally became my primary protein (I love sushi). If I wanted to maintain my current weight in Japan I would have to put in serious effort. It was so extremely easy to be healthy. 

I think obesity has become so bad in America because the government is not incentivized to care about our health.

luw77p5,PMME-SHIT-TALK,"I feel like that is an apt analogy. In theory, both weight loss medication and anti-depressants are used as a tool to treat people for whom lifestyle changes or other non-drug treatment approaches failed or provided only partial relief. However it seems like some/many people on both of these drug types fail to earnestly attempt lifestyle changes prior to, or during, drug treatment for their issues. Anecdotal but of the few people I know who are on anti-depressants and speak openly about it, none of them practice lifestyle methods to treat or improve their mental health. From what they tell me, they do not exercise, they binge drink, dont view adequate sleep as important, etc. Or, something in their life is making them miserable and they fail to change it. Then, based on the way they talk about their mental health treatment, when they experience intractable or a re-occurrence of mental health symptoms, their first and only approach is to speak with their doctor about medication adjustments.  It is my personal opinion that *some* people with mental health struggles, while it may not be entirely their fault, fail to take responsibility for the things they can do to improve their situation. Clinical depression and depression caused by or strongly influenced by situations, stress, or some sort of factor in their lives are different but are often treated the same way, and seen the same way by sufferers.

I think this also applies to *some* people with GLP-1 medications. I know 2 people who've talked about being on them. One person legitimately has spent years dieting and exercising and cannot lose weight past a point. The other person clearly just lacks the discipline to adopt and maintain a healthier diet and exercise routine. They eat like shit and eat large portions. They've tried certain diets that they eventually give up on. One told me they gave up because they didnt like the foods they were instructed by a dietician to eat, and didnt like exercise. People like this are the ones for whom I think the weight loss medications are a bandaid that do not treat the root cause of their weight issues, or at least are a sort of shortcut, because their issue is foundationally a lack of discipline. They could end up being someone who cannot lose weight past a certain point if they did stick to a healthier lifestyle, but they never get to that point to find out because they fail to stick with the beneficial changes they attempt.",1730484393.0,8,t1_luw0gre,3,8,0

I honestly would not recommend a CGM (or even constant finger sticks) for anyone who isn't a Type 1 or insulin dependent diabetic. Check it periodically or if you're having symptoms.

luwj9oh,Prince_Marf,"I didn't *choose* to walk everywhere and eat better, I was forced to by the conditions I lived in. I cannot walk everywhere in America because the community I live in is car-centric and it would take me hours to get to work. I cannot simply eat sushi every day because fresh seafood is extremely expensive.

But McDonalds's is right there and I can get a 1250 calorie meal for under ten bucks. I didn't have that option in Japan. There was McDonald's but I would have had to walk 15 minutes there and back to get it and the portion sizes were smaller. Sushi won the battle because it was easier, not because I was making a deliberate health-conscious choice.

The only *choice* I made was to go to Japan. I need broad choices like this that I can commit to without being able to back out. Frankly if I could have afforded to go home early I probably would have. The novelty wore off after a couple weeks and I missed American food. But I had to finish my semester. My parents were paying so I couldn't just back out.

mh10jfq,FlayR,"I think you're correct, but anecdotally I'd say it's also pretty variable on genetics.


Personally, below about 20% bf, my NEAT drops quite rapidly even on fairly pedestrian deficits. Further to that, below 20% bf my metabolism just adapts pretty quick too, after 2-3 weeks at like a 350 calorie deficit my resting heart rate can drop like 12-15 BPM. Above that 20% bf number, I personally didn't see much concern even at like a 1000 kcal deficit for several months. But as I get to around 15% bf or below - my metabolic adaptation just sky rockets.


I find I have the most success cutting when I keep the deficit to around 350-500 calories for about 3 weeks, and then spend 3-4 days in a caloric surplus of around 500 kcals. When I don't do that, I find my metabolism just tanks and even if I'm only trying to drop like 5-10 lbs after the initial loss of water/glycogen, my TDEE quickly becomes like 1500-1800 kcal within about 6-8 weeks. But if I do the 3-4 days of a surplus, my TDEE will stay in the 2500-2800 kcal range.


Obviously trying to stay at a 500 kcal deficit when you're only eating 1000 kcal a day is... Awful. Trying to do it at 2300 kcal a day is relatively easy.

Ozempic was originally designed to help control blood sugar levels for diabetics. Its origins had nothing to do with weight loss. When it was first created in labs, they did not set out to create a weight loss drug.

""Ben: This was as early as the early mid-90s, this was the thinking?

Lotte: Yes, it was.

Ben: I think this is important to underscore for listeners. This is extremely different from the widely held belief in most media right now that is about Ozempic. What you commonly read is that they were seeking a diabetes drug and oh my god, in this most recent study they stumbled upon this idea that it's amazing for weight loss. You're saying, no, from the very beginning, we thought that this could do both.

Lotte: Yeah, it is a common misunderstanding. I think that maybe a little bit comes also for the lizard story. It's just not true. We were the only company for 20 years that pursued obesity. The weight loss that was seen with Exenatide and also with some of the other early agents were never going to be enough to obtain an approval for the treatment of obesity.

Somehow these fatty acid acetylated compounds actually do a little bit better on weight loss. We saw that. I guess we were also a little bit lucky. There's some luck to everything that we didn't know, of course, going in with this fatty acid acetylation technology that would work or actually work even a little bit better for obesity than some of the other methods. **But we did have a strategic intent to go after obesity early on.**

We've been alone in that for the longest time in keeping up with the medical community experts out there. We've just been going at it for 20 years. It's only within maybe a little bit more than five years that we see other companies going in and now everyone's in there. Back then it was only us. There was a lot of interest in obesity also in pharma, but they all wanted to make small molecules that would deeply penetrate the brain.

There were some made, but then there were side effects. There was also a hormone, I don't know if you stumbled upon a hormone called leptin that is produced by the fat tissue, that was another idea that is approved today for lipodystrophy.""",1723742426.0,7,t3_1esz1vx,0,7,0

luw3imu,Prince_Marf,"&gt;why are you letting people who don't think it's good to be so overweight it takes decades off your life span influence your thinking at all? 

I'm not. If you read carefully you would see I do not agree with these people. 

&gt;You seem convinced you can't lose weight ""the right way,"" and you're turning to drugs instead, so that means you see the drugs as the ""wrong"" way on some level

""The right way"" is in quotations to show that I do not agree with this statement. It is something another person would say. I believe there is no right or wrong way, only results. 

&gt;You could make no changes to your diet and non-work lifestyle and get a full time manual labor heavy lifting job.

I cannot really do this because I am almost $200,000 in debt from law school. I make enough money for the debt to be worth it, but it means I can't just experiment with other jobs. I have to build my career.

&gt;I had a friend in pretty much your position, who felt like he couldn't lose weight, felt embarrassed about going outside in public, so he started only going outside after dark and eating lots of delivery. As soon as he decided it wasn't possible for him to lose weight, he started gaining weight rapidly. You may feel like your efforts aren't helping, but giving up on them entirely is almost certainly worse than what you're currently doing. Yoni took only 18 months to go from 350 to 500 pounds. He didn't live long after he hit 600. He was 26. He was funny, kind, generous, a really good friend - I wish he'd taken drugs instead of dying.

Definitely not considering giving up my existing efforts. While my weight is bad it is relatively stable. I know it is shaving years off my life though. 

&gt;I don't know if therapy would help you lose weight, but it sounds like it might and there are very few people who *don't* benefit from a therapist.

I have tried this. It's helpful, but the therapist can only help you identify problems, they cannot do the work for you.

As for your friends, I'm genuinely sorry to hear about your loss, doesn't matter how long ago it was. I hope that you and their families have been able to recover from that situation. 

The worst part, imho, is that most severely overweight people wouldn't be if other people were kind and minded their own fucking business. The doctors from the 50s-70s were so fucking irresponsible, targeting ""overweight"" people for cruel assholes to use as guilt-free personal punching bags whenever they have an emotion.

Honestly, I think it's time for the gym and ""supplement"" industry to get the sledgehammer of ""you need to prove your shit before you say it like every other drug manufacturer, and you can't make shit up and still be in business"" regulation. 

The gym industry destroys *every single person it touches*, the supplement industry is completely untested and unregulated (sometimes mixing in untested experimental pharmaceuticals unlisted!). Plus the supplement industry supplies most of the homebrew recreational drug market with precursors! I'm against prohibition, but if you're going to make war against drugs, don't supply the drugs with ammunition!

Sorry, I'm just so fucking angry, especially when I've gone back to the studies used to create the hatred of overweight people. They were the absolute worst researched and sourced papers I've ever read in my life, they made so many methodological errors even by the standards of the day.

This is what makes Ozempic and other glp-1 drugs so revolutionary. They show sustained weight loss. Look up the headline making drug trials with semaglutide. The controls maintain less than 5% body weight loss after two years while the semaglutide users maintain a loss of 15-20% body weight.

I started seeing high insulin resistance and I had and endo who decided to prescribe it to see if it would help and it did. A few years ago I was again struggling with high insulin resistance. I am on a pump and was using roughly 150 units of insulin a day! My endo switched me to Humalog U200 and also put me on ozempic. That was a huge change for me. I saw a dramatic improvement in my sugar levels and it almost completely eliminated the dramatic spikes I'd see after eating a meal. Unfortunately my previous Insurance Company stopped covering ozempic and I spent a few months struggling again with dramatic spikes and drops. After my divorce this past January I switched from my ex's Insurance to my company's and they are covering my prescription for wegovy. My endo specifically prescribed it to help me lose weight.

lfk0tlj,BeneficialWarrant,"Compared to traditional appetite suppressants, the newer GLP-1 analogues are non-stimulants. This means that they don't have several adverse effects associated with stimulants. These can include interfering with sleep and strong rebound hunger when they wear off in the evening amongst others. In addition, they are quite long lasting (typically taken once per week) and can suppress hunger when a stimulant medication would have worn off in the evening. They are also more effective at lowering weight in clinical trials.

As for what the drugs are, they are short peptide hormones that are slightly modified. They have an unusual amino acid to prevent it from being degraded by the normal enzyme which turns off GLP-1 (DPP4, half life of about 5 minutes) and a modification that lets it bind to a protein in the blood called albumin, preventing it from being quickly excreted by the kidneys (half life about an hour) as well as a modification that prevents it from upsetting your immune system.

The hormone GLP-1 is produced in the small bowel from proglucagon. It is essentially a ""I have just eaten"" signal. It makes the pancreas produce more insulin, slows down emptying of the stomach, and suppresses hunger in the brain amongst other things. GLP-1 analogue medications essentially turn the ""I've just eaten"" hormone on 24/7.",1722289967.0,6,t3_1ef49pn,0,6,0

luvo9h2,Nerril,"Bariatric surgery could be considered wrong as well under this thought process, since you also take in less food and nutrients solely because you've had access to part of your digestive system removed/limited. Medications like ozempic \*could\* offer a less invasive option for people, and would also have the benefit of curbing the hunger signals sent from the brain, creating a more normal sense of hunger in the body for people who have overactive signals. That'd be helpful to a lot of people who have messed up signals due to illness, trauma, etc, and I think when done correctly (becoming more active and making better food choices while on ozempic) would lead to better overall results in the long term. It would also be more beneficial to creating a healthier sense of intake limitation, rather than just eating less because you know there's actual danger of you hurting yourself in a surgical sense if you overeat, so you might still have the signals going, but know you CAN'T eat more, so you just have to sit through it. (Which sounds like something that would really suck, and I could see that leading to disordered eating if not monitored.)

mhvkeoi,SincerelySasquatch,"Hi. I'm on Ozempic for both diabetes and weight loss. I also have binge eating disorder and a history of anorexia. I'm going to be honest with you... Ozempic controls my diabetes way better than my previous medicine. No matter what I eat, my blood sugar never goes high or low. Your dad might be seeing this and feeling a sense of freedom, especially if he has been living with a lot of eating restrictions. It sounds like he may have some binge/restrict type patterns, if his mother was anorexic.

 I will tell you that, for me at least and I'm sure others, appetite does eventually come back once you've reached your goal dose. I'm on 2 mg and have lost 45 lbs and while my appetite is definitely lower than before ozempic it has come back a lot. if I'm not careful about what I eat and overeat or eat when I'm not hungry, I can tell you I would definitely be gaining weight back. So while what he is doing right now might be ""working"" for him, unless he sticks to healthy eating habits, he won't lose much or will regain.

 Iirc in trials of Ozempic for diabetes where the people weren't following diet and exercise routines they didn't lose much. I know people on it who didn't change their eating habits who didn't really lose anything. Or he could lose and regain. Also, even if he has very good control of his blood sugar right now, eating a lot of processed food/high glycemic index carbs will cause the disease to progress faster than if you keep those things mostly out of your diet, even if his blood sugar is under good control right now. 

Going to a nutritionist might help him. If he has eating issues retained from his upbringing an intuitive eating nutritionist might be best, as they will help him feel less restricted, allow him to eat a variety of foods, and no foods are off limits. they just help you gently shift your diet healthier and learn moderation.",1742015314.0,5,t3_1jb7v8f,0,5,0

lnr7fh4,JacketDapper944,"I think that weight, and a healthy weight maintenance, has been conflated with moral superiority when for the vast majority of Americans a healthy lifestyle requires significant extra work. 

Some examples:

Basic domestic maintenance used to be a far more labor intensive process. Washing clothes, sweeping floors, maintaining comfort required a level of physical input that we have designed around. Cars, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dish washers, lawn mowers, etc. have all made life easier and require less sweat equity (and we continue to make things lighter and more automated).

Processed foods with high quantities of fats sugars were rare and generally more expensive than the raw components for previous generations. Food companies have tested specific metrics on how sweet/fat something can be to be the most addictive to our monkey brains and corn subsidies has totally changed the American diet. Combine that with the massive convenience of drive through pre-cooked meals. They’re designed to stimulate the wiring that was designed over millennia to encourage necessary fat storage for survival. We are not designed for abundance, especially abundance with little to no nutritive value. Resisting the urge to just grab something quick also requires either planning ahead or massive amounts of intention to override the internal programming.

Movement to and from places used to require a lot more physicality. We prioritized a highway system over public transportation. We built sprawling suburbs with nary a town center or grocery store in sight. We centralized city planning around cars and parking and not around people.

The obesity epidemic is the culmination and unintentional consequence of a race for profit built on the reward centers in our brains. Sure, people can overcome their internal programming, spend hours planning so they can have healthy choices as easily as they have unhealthy ones and do all of this ahead of decision fatigue so they’re not as tempted by the cheap, easy, convenient thing… and that requires the ability to shop for and prepare food ahead of time.  It’s not a moral failing when they don’t have that capacity. It’s also true that there are people who simply do not struggle as much with these challenges because of brain chemistry and physiology. There are genetic components that can be triggered by previous generations that will impact germ cells.

All of this to say if there are medication interventions that help with satiety, that gently “shush” the parts of our genetic code designed to survive famine (and incidentally have shown some other truly interesting results in impulse control for non-food related addiction such as alcohol in addition to some fascinating results with plaque buildup in the brain) I say do what is right for you knowing there’s risk. Our inventiveness as a species in the area of calorie procurement and distribution has outpaced our evolutionary incentives, so logically until evolution can catch up (or we radically change the structure of society) utilizing another tool for prolonging survival seems logical to me.",1726676745.0,5,t3_1fju8m7,0,5,0

lnsr90e,Snoozinsioux,"I’d go to an Ozempic sub, but some things to consider (I’m taking Mounjaro):

1. These medications have starter doses, and it often takes several titrations up to get to a therapeutic dose for weightloss.

2. Have you lost any weight? Sometimes we think we’re not doing well, but a half a pound a week is a healthy amount of loss and since the main target for the drug is to lower blood sugar, many people stay on doses that work for that so weight loss is only about 10-15lbs. 

3. Are you tracking calories? Many of us do because you have to be in a calorie deficit for weight loss. If you are over or UNDER eating, you will not lose weight. The medication isn’t causing the weight loss, the calorie deficit from the appetite suppression is what causes the weight loss. 

4. How’s your muscle mass? Muscle has a lot to do with metabolism and if you’ve lost any, you’re going to struggle. Now is a great time to do things that will build your muscles.

5. How’s your overall diet? Build your meals around lean protein and eat lots of vegetables. I’d personally avoid keto and go back to a sustainable mix of foods that keep you in a calorie deficit.

From the linked article: 

A recent study conducted by the Karolinska Institutet has found that people with type 2 diabetes who are treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, such as Ozempic, have a reduced risk of developing dementia. The findings, published in the journal eClinicalMedicine, suggest that this class of medication could have a protective effect on cognitive health for diabetic patients.

Out of the 88,381 participants, those who started treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists had a notably lower incidence of dementia compared to those who used dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. Specifically, the incidence rate of dementia was 6.7 per 1000 person-years for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, 11.8 for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and 13.7 for sulfonylureas.

The weighted analysis, which adjusted for various baseline characteristics, showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists were associated with a 31% lower risk of dementia compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and a 59% lower risk compared to sulfonylureas. Even when considering adherence to the medication (per-protocol analysis), the protective effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists remained significant.",1720730338.0,5,t3_1e0z14l,0,5,0

This meant that when following a healthy diet or at least staying within usually recommended calorie restrictions for his body weight, he was still in a permanent caloric surplus since finishing the non-sustainable weight loss regime.

Just last year, a study on obese mouse fat cells showed that even when losing weight, being fat induced long-term changes that didn't go away within the analytic time frame.

kwjcu52,GojenAP1012,"I’ve been on semaglutide since February 2023 and I’m down -80-ish lbs so far. When I started, I was over 320 lbs. I’ve been overweight and obese for most of my life. I’ve tried several programs along with exercise in the past to lose weight. While most have worked, eventually I would gain the weight back and then some.

The side effects that I deal with are nausea and really bad constipation. I also need to remind myself to drink water so I’m not dehydrated. I also get what I call dad burps due to slower digestion from my stomach. My poor husband was downwind of one of my burps 😬

It has helped quiet down the food noise in my head and my portions are less. Like others have mentioned, since I’ve been on this med I don’t drink as much alcohol as I used to. If I do drink, it’s 1-2 drinks max every couple of months. 

My health insurance does cover Ozempic and Wegovy but my doctor had to submit a prior authorization form otherwise it was an automatic denial from my insurance. Another hurdle I ran into was once I got the authorization, getting the med from my pharmacy took a long time. For my initial dose of Wegovy, it took my pharmacy 4 months to get it. 

I wound up getting a compounded version that I’ve been taking which has helped. It’s not cheap, but it’s cheaper than if I paid out of pocket for Wegovy and so far I haven’t had any issues getting this med or any adverse side effects.",1711397205.0,5,t3_1bnhjct,0,5,0

Sounds like you are ‘skinny fat’ body type so under muscled is your issue.

I’m also restarting Low dose ozempic but it’s mainly to reduce inflammation &amp; satiety.

Weight loss is mainly due to diet.

When bodybuilders want to gain muscle they stay high protein, but increase their carbs &amp; fat intake while doing regular resistance exercise.

I put your rough stats into the bodybuilding TDEE calculator that I use. Check it out:

https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&amp;g=male&amp;age=36&amp;lbs=130&amp;in=64&amp;act=1.2&amp;bf=10&amp;f=2

NOTE:  these are your stats ‘as if’ you were at ideal bodyweight of 130lbs

Your avg reference (leanest) weight for your height &amp; sex is ~ 130 lbs

So for you, might try a bulking routine, resistance training 3-4x/week &amp; something like these macros:

About 1700 kcal/day

PROTEIN: 130g minimum

CARBS: Total 40g/NET 25g maximum 


FATS: 120g 
Healthy whole food fat only: EVOO, UNREFINED COCONUT OIL, AVOCADO, GRASS FED BUTTER/GHEE, BEEF TALLOW
(No seed oils or processed)


The higher protein &amp; higher fat from whole foods can often help also increase testosterone which is crucial to building increased lean muscle.

Also if nec, try a wuality whey protein ISOLATE supplement to meet your protein goal.  I use ISOPURE, TRANSPARENT LABS, or NOW.  The isolate version is best for muscle building, imho.

Geyba kitchen food scale (they are cheap) &amp; try a free macro tracking app like my fitness pal or carbmanager.com.  Tracking macros will really help get to your goal faster. 

So, (not medical advice) but just some thoughts based upon my training experience. Hope it’s helpful!!

lux9e0q,drzowie,"&gt;I will say that the obesity epidemic in our country is a mix of both failure at the personal level and failure of our government. Failure at the personal level due to a lack of self-control, a lack of desire to educate themselves, and a lack of motivation to improve. Failure of the government by allowing companies to effectively poison us, push products to make people addicted to unhealthy food, and run campaigns to obfuscate the ill effects to the public.

The Big Lie is that, once a person *starts* down the path to obesity, they just have to buckle down and they can get off that path.  That's not really true.  The lesson of the GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon pathways is that there really is a non-conscious feedback system that controls appetite and metabolism.  That system is susceptible to a particular set of failure modes, and once those modes are triggered it's very rare for anyone to be able to override them long-term.  

We're not talking about a personal failure, in the sense of a failure of willpower or people making a conscious choice to get fat.  Obesity as we know it is intrinsic to the way that humans are structured, interacting with the larger systems of which we are a part.  There's a familiar litany of the reasons why highly processed/optimized-for-craviness foods are bad for us -- but once that badness becomes evident and a person starts gaining weight, the failure mode dominates that person's life and there is often no way out.  *Losing* weight, in particular, seems to trigger stronger cravings and lower metabolism *in the long run*, meaning that the ""set point theory"" has some actual reality.  

It's worse than that.  If you've talked to even a few fat people, you'll have heard complaints about ""my metabolism is really slow"", and there's something to that.  Some people's bodies will go to extreme lengths to avoid releasing fat -- to the extent that they'll develop hypothermia or hypoglycemia rather than convert fat to glycogen in times of dieting/famine.  One reason tirzepatide seems to be more effective than semaglutide is that it is an agonist for the GIP system, which encourages the liver to metabolize fat into glycogen, making that available to fuel the body.  That belies the perennial ""how could you not be losing weight?  You ate like half the RDA of calories.  You must be cheating"" thermodynamic line of reasoning.  If GLP-1 regulates g'zinta (modifying appetite and reducing how much food g'zinta the body), GIP regulates g'zouta, by helping metabolize fat to sustain a high metabolism even without food.

All of that is to say, it's not necessarily a personal failure for people to get fat or to be unable to lose extra weight.  It can and should be treated as a pathology, not as a moral failing.",1730496566.0,4,t1_luvnoe7,1,4,0

mgzd6sa,HKei,"&gt;If you're replacing fat for muscle

That's not how that works. First of all, I don't know if this is just unfortunate phrasing, but to clarify of course fat tissue doesn't literally turn into muscle tissue. 

The other thing is that you lose fat a _lot_ faster than you can gain muscle. Leaving aside drugs, if you diligently train for hypertrophy you'd be lucky to gain 10lbs of muscle in a year — if you had low muscle mass before and you're genetically gifted maybe as much as 20lbs in your first year of training, but that's _very_ optimistic. Whereas you can easily lose in excess of 50lbs of fat even if you're not on a particularly strict diet. More so if you're morbidly obese or you're on a bit more extreme diet. 

If you're actually overweight, and you train and diet at the same time, yes you will gain some weight from muscles and lose some weight from fat. But your weight should still be going down overall, and the weight gain from muscles should be more or less a rounding error. You're simply not putting on so much mass so quickly, otherwise everyone who managed to semi-consistently hit the gym would look like a fitness influencer. Like if you're 6'1 weighing 220lbs to begin with, it's kinda ridiculous to try to maintain that weight if you're trying to lose fat — if you're lean at that weight and height you're basically a pro bodybuilder already.",1741587233.0,4,t1_mgxt1uk,3,4,0

The first stage is where there’s a ton of benefits, particularly relative to the cost of NOT losing weight. My question about long term use is whether or not the secondary stage, where the body reaches a new equilibrium with the use of the drugs, is inherently safe. 

I remember one article mentioning that GLP inhibitors has a significant impact, for instance, on lean muscle mass. Would we expect to see more relative injuries in older populations using the drugs?

lnsqob0,International-Main48,"First, let me start by saying I'm not a Dr or fitness guru. Yet, I have been learning a lot recently on my journey. Here are my thoughts on the subject. 

If Ozempic is bringing down your BS, great! That is exactly what is supposed to happen. Another thing that happens, is the meds like Ozempic suppress your appetite. So it sounds like you've been successful with changing your eating habits and I'd assume Ozempic has assisted with your cravings and such to help you cut carbs etc. Again, doing what it's supposed to do. That said, the Ozempic doesn't need a jump start. It seems to be doing exactly what it is intended to do. 

What needs a jumpstart to losing weight is your metabolism! (This is where I'm struggling at the moment also) when we consume less calories over time, our body adjust (lowers) our Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). I recommend you eat more protien (which is why keto is giving results) and start some strength training to build muscle. This will raise your BMR and your body will start to burn more fat. You may gain some weight at 1st but it be muscle. A smart scale will help show you if your fat is dropping while muscle mass is increasing. In other words, your composition may change and it will ultimately lead to fat loss. 

Another method for boosting the metabolism is Intermittent Fasting (IF). This is tricky for us diabetics. But IF is the next step on my journey. It looks promising. Join that sub reddit also.

I am a 41 year old, been T1 for about 30 years, and have become extremely insulin resistant.  I am taking about 150 units per day (2.5 u/hour basal, 1:6 carb ratio).  For the past 3 years, I have been experiencing the same exercise issue you have.  I can be sitting all day at work, fighting to keep my sugar below 200.  As soon as I do any physical activity, my sugar will start to plummet, as if the insulin on board was jump started to work.  I am currently on metaphomine to help with resistance, but I cannot tell if it does anything.  I am currently on the T Slim Pump with a G6 dexcom.  I use the IQ control, which automates some bolus' if I need them.  But still, the control IQ cannot keep up.  So I do a correction bolus and it makes a small difference.  Sometimes I will take a brisk 30 min walk when my sugar wont come down, and I have quite a bit of Insulin On Board (IOB), and that seems to trigger it to start to come down.  

So, I have been thinking about talking to my Endo about either Mounjaro, or Ozempic.  As it appears my insurance (HAP) will cover those medications.  But of course, like you I am afraid of severe hypos, as my sugar levels are also on a rollercoaster.  ITs a balance between amount of insulin and my activity level.

There are people on this site that can only tolerate half the regular starting dose.  Others who go up slowly every 6-8 weeks rather than every 4.

If your wife had tailored her dose to manage her side effects, she may have had a lot of success with it.  You will be much more educated by the time you are approved, and will likely be successful.

jjs5p1s,Bryek,"Sorry, bad choice of words. By ""poorly managed"" I did not mean you were eating sugar or doing things diabetics shouldn't, just that the meds you are taking are not adequate to control your BGL at a safe level without additional insulin. No slight to you was intended. Sometimes our bodies just dont like us. My mother in law is the same way. Does all the right things but could not get the sugar below a 12 (216). She has a terrible doctor and won't listen to me. She just recently got ozempic and has managed to get her numbers under control.

Overall, Ozempic will do the same thing that Metformin will do for your insulin resistance (release insulin in response to food intake) but ozempic will do it better. 

Metformin works by telling your pancreas to always be producing more insulin. Ozempic will only tell the pancreas to produce it when you need it. Whether it will cause your pancreas to produce enough to get off insulin? We won't know for a while. Whether you can get off metformin? We'll metformin does have a lot of endothelial health benefits as well so if you don't go off of it, it isn't a bad thing. 

Side note: we don't often get tested for insulin resistance (it's not an easy test to do) and we also don't often get tested for insulin levels specifically. Most everything is based off of blood sugar levels. So unless you've done those tests, it is entirely possible you don't produce enough insulin in the first place. Which could be why you need the long lasting insulin to maintain your BGL. It could all be insulin resistance. Or it could be insulin resistance with exhausted beta islet cells.",1683834700.0,3,t1_jjs3lzj,2,3,0

lfu71s3,Sassrepublic,"You’ve heard incorrectly. People taking semaglutide for weight loss are taking Wegovy, not Ozempic. Wegovy is FDA approved as a treatment for overweight and obesity. Wegovy is not prescribed to diabetics, as they need to be on the lower dose with Ozempic. (And no one who wants it for weight loss wants the lower dose that’s less effective.) People who want to take semaglutide who don’t meet the FDAs criteria as overweight or obese are using compounded semaglutide, which does not effect the available supply of either Ozempic or Wegovy. Ozempic is in short supply for diabetics because there are *a whole fucking lot of type 2 diabetics* in this country. 

And to be clear, no one “needs” semaglutide. It’s not insulin. The advice to overweight people to just lose weight “naturally” applies equally to those with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 is caused by being overweight, and 99% of the time resolves with weight loss. Diabetics are not more deserving of this medication than people who are overweight without diabetes. And shortages are going to continue to grow, because there are trials going now to get approval for semaglutide as a treatment for Alzheimer’s, addictions, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. (Cardiovascular benefits were seen in those who lost zero weight, before anyone asks.)

I am very aware of this being on it, but I don’t view it any differently than doing weight watchers and stopping or keto and stopping, I’ve done it all and gained back every time I quit doing those things.  I’ve been on it for 8 months now, lost 35 pounds (my starting bmi was 30).  I am starting to experience more hunger and some of the initial effects are wearing off.  I am starting to track calories again as I know I will need to in order to continue to lose and then To maintain.  It helped me when nothing else worked, I had gone for 2 years trying and basically gaining and losing the same 5 lbs no matter what I did, I started wegovy and all of the sudden I could lose again doing those same things.  I only want to lose 5-10 more pounds and then maintain but I fully expect to have keep putting on the work to do that, it’s not necessarily complete magic, as in you don’t have to do anything, but it helps people who can’t lose by simple diet and exercise.",1711453650.0,3,t3_1bnhjct,0,3,0
kuo02ej,principalgal,"I started on Ozempic about a month ago the .25 dose. My sugars are a million times better and no dawn phenomena at all! I stay in range nearly all the time. I’m moving to .5 at my next appointment in a week ish. to try to get my mini spikes out. My 30 day average sugar is 113. My A1C was 7.9 last month so big difference so far. I’ve lost about 8 pounds and then stayed flat. My big side effect has been a bit of heartburn every now and again. 

I was originally on 1000 Metformin (500 mg 2 times a day) and could tolerate it. Before the Ozempic, my doc upped my Metformin to 2000 and HELLS NO! It was awful. So we added Ozempic and downed Metformin back to the OG dose 🤣.  I’m hoping I can cut it down more when Oz goes up. 

I am a picky eater eater too, OP. I make sure I have protein and veggies or a salad as much as possible for anything else. I like to snack on almonds and sunflower seeds (so much fun to eat 🤣). I can now tolerate bread!!! So a sandwich for lunch is back in the realm of possibility. I couldn’t eat bread or rice ever before. Now I can in small quantities.

Because it reduces *excessive* appetite. It doesn't prevent you from eating nutritious foods or eliminate them from your body immediately after you've eaten them. 

The gastrointestinal side effects can be pretty miserable on higher doses, but doses can be adjusted. I wasn't able to tolerate the standard dose and was vomiting all the time. And yes, that's a terrible and unhealthy way to lose weight. 

Dose adjustment was a simple fix to that. 

I still eat plenty of food, lol. I just no longer have my brain and body screaming that I'm still starving when I've just eaten.

Although GLP-1 is not right for me, I have been experiencing insulin resistance lately and I mentioned to my endo that a lot of T1 people are successfully reducing insulin resistance with these medications. He said yes, that’s true, but there’s also an increase in deaths because it’s harder to treat lows. 

These drugs essentially slow down digestion quite a bit, so your food stays in your stomach for a prolonged period of time, rather than moving on to the intestines at a normal pace. For people who are seeking weight loss, this makes them feel full and also sends a signal to the brain that the stomach is full, so they don’t feel hungry. 

For a T1 approaching or experiencing low blood sugar, this food that’s parked in the stomach can also slow the absorption of glucose tablets or other treatment so the way you would normally treat a low may not be sufficient.

I’m not saying that T1s should not take these meds, lots of people seem to be having success with them. I just want to increase awareness about the potential danger for T1 people so we can take care of ourselves and stay safe.

lfjymv6,GMN123,"I was on the verge of obesity (BMI of 29) with a non-diabetes medical condition that would be significantly improved by losing weight. I'm on a low dose (2.5mg) of mounjaro (not exactly the same as semaglutide but very similar) and it has been a miracle for me. Previously I was able to lose a few kilos at a time but it required an eternal fight with a hunger that never went away, and every time I eventually faltered. Now I'm losing about a kg a week with zero adverse effects, still eating well without feeling ick but without the desire to overeat, to snack between meals, or to eat much junk food. I might still occasionally grab a takeaway, but I'll have half a serving and finish it the next meal, or have a small burger but no chips or drink. Mostly I feel like a modest serve of protein and some vegetables. Essentially, it makes eating like we've always been told to feel natural. 


2.5mg is meant to be a 4 week initiation dose before stepping up, but I've been on it for 7 weeks now and will likely stay on it unless it stops working. Eating any less would probably be trying to lose weight too fast (I'm at about 1700 cals a day which for a man of my height/activity is about an 800 calorie/day deficit) so I see no point risking adverse symptoms with a higher dose and my doctor agrees.  I follow a number of glp-1 subreddits and I see people being pushed onto higher and higher doses because it's 'the schedule'. I suspect over time lower doses of these medications may become standard for a lot of people who will see significant benefit with fewer side effect, and perhaps even lower doses available for maintenance when goal weight is achieved. ",1722289219.0,3,t1_lfitfj1,1,3,0

k0nu3c7,misskaminsk,"I was recognized as having detectable c-peptide and random insulin production causing excessive scary lows when I was first diagnosed with t1 a few years after failing an OGTT. I was started on insulin at 22, right away, but then saw a research endocrinologist who explained that there was data on this drug Victoza in t1 like me and he put me on it once I got my A1c below 7.5 on my own. I was able to cut insulin in half, which was huge because I was extremely resistant when my pancreas wasn’t making little amounts of insulin, and scared to death of lows living alone in a big city. I was skinny, but I had never heard of the drug and had no idea about weight loss. I didn’t lose weight, either. 

Victoza had me honeymooning for a few more years until insurance yanked coverage, and when I was off it, I immediately went back to being incredibly “brittle” and constantly battling unpredictable insulin needs. I also developed an eye bleed and seizures (not bg related—maybe microvascular badness in the brain too?) while off of it.
I fought like hell with insurance to get back on. My eye is normal. My seizures are hopefully resolved, and I will learn more in the EMU soon, but there are already early signals of possible benefits of GLP-1 drugs in epilepsy if I am not mistaken. 

I’m now on 0.5 of Ozempic. My BMI is 18 or 18.5, whatever is the low end of normal but not underweight. It takes weeks to reach steady state, and it is night and day when it is in my system or not. I will not fully give up this drug. 

The knowledge translation gap is real. It seems like on some level, we’ve known these drugs are the next big thing for years. I do think people need to be careful and pay attention to their bodies though. These shouldn’t be taken if you’re sick with a stomach thing, or underweight, or they’re causing you to have side effects like nausea and malaise that cause you not to eat or take you put of your normal activities. Like anything, they can’t do everything. But I find it an indispensable tool in my care. 

The conversation around all if the health benefits other than weight loss has been limited by the public conversation about these drugs being primarily centered on the weight loss doses and the effects of those. I’m never going to be on a weight loss dose of Ozempic. I don’t want to be, because I don’t need to be. But I sure as hell want stable blood sugars, predictable insulin needs, and to get the protective benefits for my eyes, heart, brain, et cetera. My quality of life being able to manage my diabetes is night and day. 

TLDR - 
1. Ozempic great at weight appropriate dose for T1 and likely T3c too I would imagine(?), and will be ripped from my cold dead hands. 

2. People having problems on them are likely on too high a dose (you can titrate more slowly than the doses on the box with your endo! if you have nasty side effects or feel like shit, lay off!) or can’t tolerate them. 

3. Let’s start talking about all of the benefits that are not weight loss. And let’s advocate for access and coverage.",1694757454.0,3,t3_16ihmtv,0,3,0

Type 2 diabetes is also common in older people, although there are rarer cases where thin and/or fit people get type 2 diabetes.

luz9shz,DemandAffectionate49,"Insulin resistance is a condition where your body’s cells don’t respond properly to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. When cells become resistant, the pancreas compensates by producing more insulin to help glucose enter the cells, leading to elevated insulin levels. This can contribute to weight gain and potentially progress to type 2 diabetes if not managed.

However, when you’re on Ozempic (semaglutide), insulin resistance won’t cause you to gain weight—quite the opposite. Ozempic works by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion only when blood sugar levels are high, reduces appetite, and slows down digestion. This medication helps reduce insulin surges and stabilizes insulin levels, improving insulin sensitivity. As a result, it can facilitate weight loss by allowing your body to use insulin more effectively and reducing fat storage.

So, instead of causing weight gain, Ozempic can help you lose weight by addressing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. If you have any concerns or are experiencing unexpected effects, it’s important to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can offer personalized advice and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.",1730526741.0,2,t1_lubqa9f,3,2,0

If you are morbidly obese (for the sake of example let's say 450 pounds) then these drugs can absolutely help you kickstart your weight loss journey.

Notice my choice of the word kickstart. When you really think about it, Ozempic is just an extreme diet. It doesn't alter your metabolism to where you can lose weight after eating a birthday cake. It suppresses your appetite so that you eat less. 

What happens with the majority of people when they reach their goal weight? They return to their old habits and gain the weight back. In fact, over 80% do

https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/healthy-living/obesity/weight-loss-maintenance.html

https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/weighing-facts-tough-truth-about-weight-loss

I have no doubt that most people who take Ozempic will stop when they reach their goal weight. They also never truly developed good eating habits. They didn't develop self discipline. They took a drug that kept them from eating. 

They will almost certainly gain it back. For the majority of people with a weight problem, simply changing your diet and habits will help. You may need a health coach to help, but it can be achieved and once you develop those habits and make them your lifestyle, you will keep it off.

Ozempic doesn't do that. That is where my gripe exists.",1730507021.0,2,t3_1gh8oh6,0,2,0

Once I got up to a therapeutic dose - any foods/meals that would have given me mild GI distress (a bunch of red meat as an example) would give me liquid poops for days. My energy levels plummeted and I just had zero physical energy to do anything.

After about 6 weeks, I developed really nasty shoulder pain that prevents me from throwing a ball or lifting any weight more than ~5lbs over my head comfortably (and is weirdly a known side effect.)

I also lost zero pounds. I’d lost ~40lbs from just taking Metformin and being a bit more active and then stalled out. Hoped it would help me lose the remaining 30 to get to my “happy place” but no luck.

I’ve now been “off” for ~8 weeks, have put on about 10lbs more than when I started Wegovy, and my shoulder pain hasn’t gone away - but I have my energy back and don’t feel like a tired and useless sack all the time.

I did a lot of power zone training on the peloton previously and I’m ~15% lower than I was when I started after not being having the energy to do any of it for ~12 weeks. Which is unusual since I’ve taken similar breaks before and not seen this big of a dip.

luvz1dt,Nuthead77,"Oooh I can talk a lot about this one having been on both sides.

I was almost 350 pounds 10 years ago.  I’ve been mostly maintaining under 250 since, less one spike back up to 265ish.  6’1” male, built big and wide, so ideally I should be 185-190.  Currently at 230ish.  So, I’m definitely still overweight and have been for 10 years but no longer morbidly obese like I was for the previous 10.

The thing that I’ve learned the most is that it is more mental than anything else.  It needs to be tackled like any other addiction, food in this case.  I hear a lot of people saying oh just work out more, but in reality it’s 90% in the kitchen and only 10% the gym.

There’s levels to how to address it just like with any other addiction.  Cold turkey if possible or a taper if not is always the best option.  This is naturally dealing with the problem.  If that doesn’t work then you can get into pharmaceuticals and if all else fails, more drastic measures.

The root physical cause of obesity is simply eating more calories than you burn.  The mental aspect must be defeated though to have life long results.  A lot of people loose the weight only to put it back on.  So, you should never start trying to lose weight by getting on pharmaceuticals- it won’t solve the mental reasons for theroot cause and will also fail in many cases.  It should be reserved for extreme cases of many attempts and failures because if you lose weight that way then you either need to keep taking it for life or you will most likely gain it back since you didn’t learn to correct the behavior.

Let’s be honest, we all know it’s possible and it’s a lack of willpower in 99% of failed attempts.  That’s the mental part.  So if we kickstart the process with drugs, what makes you think that you’ll magically be fixed instead of correcting the behavior?  Before you’ve had a drastic weight loss the mentality is oh if I just get it off then I’ll be good. No, that’s the easier of the two halves.  Maintaining the weight loss is much more difficult.  A hundred pounds can pretty easily be knocked off in 6 months but you have to keep with it forever to maintain for life.  

So, it is inherently wrong (for your long term health) to loose weight via drugs IF you haven’t had many failed attempts before and are in a more dire circumstance.  You are not addressing the root cause of it being a food addictions leading to more calories in then out.  You also ought to opt to naturally fix your issues before committing to lifelong pharmaceutical use for a problem that can likely be resolved naturally.

It also blocks the secretion of glucagon (which would otherwise raise blood sugar).

I've been able to drop from about 60 units a day to 30-40 pretty consistently. I can't say my overall levels have changed much or that I experience less highs or lows. 
I've also dropped about 16lbs, so not massive, but I also don't take a big dose.

What I would warn about is I didn't know before starting it that it changes your sensitivity to insulin, so lesson learned. I also had to make changes around my sugar management and exercise and planning that low corrections take longer because your stomach empties slower so any sugar you ingest takes longer to hit. It's not a make or break issue but it's definitely something to be aware of.

But when we unwind this and try to take action where do we stop? Red meat can be unhealthy especially since people will add butter and eat it with a load of carbs. But potatoes aren't really bad for you. You can prepare any food and it can be unhealthy or you overeat. 

How do we get people who love their red meat and freak out anytime they're told to eat less of it, to actually change their habits? I mean conservatives claimed the Green New Deal would stop them from eating burgers and steaks.

Idk how we tell people across America to eat a certain way when every demographic has people who are obese. We also need to address this in so many other ways. 

We need to revamp our medical system so that people who are fat aren't just told to lose weight when they go to the doctors for a problem. That problem can and will exist regardless of weight. Making doctors offices focus on health based approach that doesn't put weight first will help get people to listen to their doctor. They can end up with lifestyle changes to lose weight. 

We also need to have people less connected to screens and not worry about productivity, which means a higher social safety net, better wages, and more time off. We need walkable cities and towns with public transit. We need spaces for people to exercise that are cheap and nice. 

We need more than a Planet Fitness and Crossfit. We need to allow people to walk and bike places. If they have stores near them that they can walk to they will buy in bulk less. Americans are addicted to places like Costco and buying mega size versions of everything. 

We need to improve our air quality and encourage people to see their doctors annually. This requires trust with our medical system which has lost favor and been replaced by quacks on YouTube. 

It's not easy to lose weight and keep it off. I've been in great shape and not so great shape. But luckily I love exercising, walking, and eating a well rounded diet. Not everyone does. So any sort of treatment that can help them is good. 

We have to work with the individual as we change society.",1730510053.0,2,t1_luvm5cb,1,2,0
luykdcr,AllowMe-Please,"I got put on Ozempic because I am already in very bad shape. I've usually managed to maintain a good weight, but I relatively recently (last five years, around age 30) became fully disabled and bedbound. That broke me and yeah, my depression got to me and I gained a bunch of weight (280 - 250 now that I'm on Ozempic). I know it's my fault, and I can just eat less. Yes, I have a ton of conditions that make it easier to gain weight and hold on to it (Hashimoto's, along with other autoimmune and degenerative diseases), but ultimately, I put the food into my mouth. But I also can't cook; I eat what is given to me.

My doctors are trying to get me to get healthier in every way possible, and that includes losing weight. The pain I am in every day is indescribable and I imagine it would feel better with it off my already degraded, grade-four arthritic joints. And yeah, it's much easier and helpful, not having that hunger drive, especially since cannabis is one of my pain reliefs and it makes you ravenous.

I think it's a useful tool. I use it for a month, take a week or two off because my stomach has shrunk enough that I literally don't need to eat as much.

Your example is very surface-level and doesn't address the very many nuances that can happen with human health. For me, it's like putting in a new filter while going shopping for a new boiler. It'll help and keep the problem at bay while even controlling it, while you get used to the new eating habits.

And yes. It does have side effects that are unpleasant. But so do my other meds.

luwqc35,Correct-Sprinkles-21,"&gt;That said, weight loss drugs do nothing to solve either of those problems. Even if you lose weight artificially, you are likely still consuming trash food that is wreaking havoc on your body because you didn’t learn the lifestyle changes necessary to consume healthy food. 

Awful lot of judgment for people you don't know. And all of it comes down to the simplistic ""fat people bad"" nonsense. The belief that fat people are only  ever fat because they're lazy gluttons, and that they have poor character and absolutely no interest in making an effort. 

These medications are typically part of a broader program to improve health for people with severe obesity. Nutritionist, education, physical therapy at times. 

Will some people misuse them? Of course. So what? And how do you get from that to making a judgment of every individual who gets medical help for weight loss? 



&gt;You likely are not going to start working out either because why would you? People will say “I would work out if I lost weight” but you can work out now. Why put in extra work if the weight stays off without it?

lol. Ozempic helped me lose enough weight so that I *could* work out sustainably. I have always tried to stay active, even at my fattest, and for many years walked a lot, even if I couldn't do anything else. But I was limited by fatigue and joint pain and that got worse and more limiting as I gained weight, which then limited me even further.

I've lost over 60 lb.  Joined a gym around 40 lb down. Increased my activity as the weight has dropped. 

Why? Because I can now. Without getting injured and without getting sick. And because I enjoy the strength and stamina that comes with working out, now that I'm able to. Because I understand the medicine is a tool, not a miracle cure.

The hazard ratios in figure 2 are quite modest, so there is clearly more to the discontinuation than just cost and GI side effects alone.

I can't prove it, but I speculate many discontinue because of the reduced hedonic experience in eating. Major part of eating, food, dining and social life circles about appetizing foods. The drug makes this part of life less enjoyable.

Here is some food for thought:
1) most people taking this medication have been battling weight for decades, not just a few years,  a history of trying many things to lose weight, some of which potentially further impaired their metabolism, and additional health issues like elevated blood glucose, sleep apnoea, etc.

2) they have less research/knowledge on young people, or on those whose weight gain is recent (and may be transitional rather than lifelong). Young people’s bodies are still developing and not as set in stone as older people.

3) If you can use this as a tool to lose the excess weight in conjunction with healthy eating and lifestyle, for all we know you might not need it going forward. If you don’t need to take this medication forever, that should be a good thing, and it is what I hope for myself even though I am one of the older more ill people and it may not be so.

4) A couple studies showed that when slowly titrated off glp-1 medication half of people didn’t regain, and those who did had varying levels of regain (only a small percent gained it all back, some had insignificant regain). Their advice was to use minimum effective dosing and titrate on and off as need, so try going off and if regain starts - can always take the medication again. 

4) focus on this step of the journey, don’t worry about the next one. There is more research, evidence and medication coming through the pipeline that will give us (and your doctor) more information to help make future decisions.",1732239960.0,2,t3_1gwqpcl,0,2,0

Side effects have been fairly mild luckily; the first 4-6 weeks it was the toughest. You will have to figure out how your body reacts to certain foods. I had the strongest reactions to spicy food and really fatty foods. Eventually I got used to ozempic and I was able to eat most things normally. I still tend to avoid fatty foods or at least I am more moderate now. I’ve adjusted to spice well and seem to be fine. 

Expect some stomach discomfort, constipation or the opposite. It seems to come in waves, usually the first day or two after the shot. These days I don’t notice a difference on day one or day seven between doses. 

I did lose weight which was a bonus, I was not large to begin with but had put on about 20lbs over the last year as my insulin usage sky rocketed. I dropped 20-25lbs in the first few months and my weight has stayed extremely steady since then.

m4mmche,LifeguardRare4431,"It’s important to be aware of a condition called euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA). This can occur even with normal blood sugar levels and is caused by a lack of insulin. While it’s not very common, it can happen when taking medications like Ozempic or other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

To stay on top of this, I recommend getting some ketone test strips to monitor your ketone levels. Small amounts of ketones are usually okay from time to time, but if you see large amounts, it’s important to contact your doctor—or even go to the ER.

If you’re having difficulty controlling your blood sugar, Ozempic or a similar medication might still be a good option for you. Just be mindful of the potential risks associated with reduced insulin levels. Most likely, your doctor will start you on a low dose, so your insulin needs might only decrease slightly.

The key is to keep an eye on your ketones while monitoring your overall health. Since you’ve already consulted your doctor about this, I’ll leave it at that—but it’s always good to stay proactive about potential side effects.",1735611517.0,2,t3_1hpse3g,0,2,0

-you DO need to have some kind of insulin resistance or insulin intake to stay out of the danger zone of insufficient insulin dosing.

Here’s to hoping the generic liraglutide will be affordable since we do not all need the big guns.

-you must keep your protein intake up. If you’re over 35 this is especially important. Don’t skimp. If you have to skimp, then you’re going to lose muscle, hair, etc. Our muscles are key to our insulin sensitivity and longevity and everyday functioning. And our faces. And the Ozempic hair phenomenon…well, ask your hairdressers. 

-Eat your fruits and vegetables and skyr because you need those pre- and probiotics for gut health 

-Stay hydrated

-If you have nausea, for the love of god lower your dose and skip until you feel better

Ozempic was my Drs first choice of med for me when we considered all the options. I didn't intentionally change my diet, Dr said it wasn't necessary at this point, but it changed some incidentally. I have zero interest in losing weight, though if it happens it happens (and it has, I've lost about 30lbs, sucks when clothes no longer fit). I did end up eating healthier because greasy meals and lots of meat made me queasy on ozempic. No restrictions on carbs, I eat mostly plant based with whole grains, lots of veges, fruit, and meat is an occasional thing. The main difference between that and before is a reduction in having a meat course with meals, and less of the fancy French cooking techniques I love because anything with heavy cream or lots of butter seems to upset my stomach now. I did start exercising more because I went through PT again for an old injury and managed to get enough pain relief to incorporate more movement into my days.

The only numbers I’m focusing on are the ones on my glucometer and my CGM.

Are the meds making the weight loss easier? Probably. Are the better decisions also helping? I’m sure of it. Even non-diabetic folks taking meds solely for weight loss have to improve their decisions at mealtime, or they won’t see the progress they’re looking for.

https://physiqonomics.com/calories/

ETA: and my personal opinion is that while the main driver of weight loss on Ozempic is probably the appetite reduction, it is well within the realm of biological plausibility that another mechanism is doing something to increase the body’s own rate of energy consumption. What is that mechanism, exactly? We don’t know, although a bunch of people in this thread have shared reasonable hypotheses. 

It is furthermore my opinion that anyone who expresses ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY about mechanism of action (including ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY that it works only by appetite reduction) doesn’t actually know much about a) physiology or b) the complexities of pharmacotherapy",1723758419.0,2,t3_1esz1vx,0,2,0

llfor9y,canthearu_ack,"Ozempic may or may not affect your weight. Weight loss is just a happy side effect of ozempic for a lot of people, as it can adjust appetite signals.

Ozempic's primary mechanism is to stimulate insulin production when blood sugars increase. It might be very effective for you if your problem is your pancreas not producing much insulin when food is eaten. It also seems to improve how receptive your cells are to using insulin and absorbing glucose.

I would say give Ozempic a go for a few months, see what it does for you. If you find your appetite too suppressed, then stop taking it. It may even have the opposite effect on you, being slightly underweight, by letting your body absorb more of the glucose you do eat, and help you gain a healthy weight.

Type 1 diabetics can have skyrocketing blood sugar but due to having no insulin they can be emaciated. Type 2 diabetics don't lack insulin, they're resistant to it (though I gather it's not uniformly across the body, different organ systems react differently) so to compensate majority will have ridiculously high insulin levels. And anyone with extra insulin puts on weight. T1DM people have been known to give themselves less insulin than would be needed to bring their sugar down, simply to lose weight, dangerous as it is to forever have high blood sugar. Even T1DM typically end up increasing their insulin needed to control their sugars in the long run, they develop resistance too.

She’s hesitant, and that should have be a warning sign.  Currently all the makers of GLP-1s are being sued in what’s called a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) 3094 or MDL-3094, google it, siri it, it’s free.

GLP-1s have been a success for many, but if you’re one of the unfortunates it can also cause damage, I mean emergency surgical intervention level damage, with painful residuals.

Everyone should be given all the information in order to make an informed decision about their health.  The makers have downplayed the potential side effects, warnings and precautions and it’s caused damage because prescribers, patients or consumers are not being properly informed.  If it’s a prescriber, there could be other implications for malpractice if they know and fail to issue properly, or warn, counsel their patients.

-Don't eat too close to bedtime as the food is more likely to get stuck in your gut overnight leading to morning nausea and even vomiting.

-Fiber supplements can also help ensure the food keeps moving and doesn't get stuck! 

-Losing weight on it is normal though not guaranteed. 

-You may want to be more vigilant against going low the first few months. To that end, invest in juices if you haven't already - these meds slow your digestion too much to rely on solid food to raise your bloodsugar but liquids will still be absorbed quickly.

mhimdxg,grundar,"&gt; I would agree that 0.7 is okay on average, but Morton et al (2018) strongly suggests that on a population level, if you want to capture that vast majority of people accurately due to individual variation, 0.7-1g/lb bodyweight is a safer bet.

For a lean lifter wanting to ensure they're getting every scrap of gainz, sure, but this comment thread is about normal people trying to lose some weight and maintain a reasonable amount of muscle.

[Here's what Morton et al (2018) says](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/):  
&gt;&gt; ""Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.""

i.e., 1.62g/kg = 0.74g/lb maxed out muscle gains from weightlifting.

Higher amounts of protein are totally fine, but if we overstate the amount of protein that's needed, there's a real risk of some people dismissing the amount of change to their diet required as infeasible and not even trying.

Back to that 150lb woman, 105g of protein per day, with probably 40g or so coming from incidental sources (bread, pasta, etc. -- ~15% protein in the macro composition x 1000cal --&gt; 150cal --&gt; ~40g), that's 65g of protein from direct sources, or [just over 200g of chicken breast per day](https://www.nutritionix.com/food/chicken-breasts/100-g) (or the equivalent).

My doctor is tracking closely (14 day email checkins on metrics including weight and my CGM numbers and reports of side effects) - but she isn't too worried about weight. 

The weight loss numbers you see are averages.. and the more overweight you are the more you lose - so you do plateau.. and if you're already at a healthy weight you would expect to lose (a lot) less.. you can't go to 0 afterall even though some people can lose 53kg. Also the weight loss dosages of semaglutide (ozempic/wegovy) are quite high.. 1.7mg or 2.4 mg where a lot of diabetics get good sugar results at 0.5 or 1.0..

Then there is the pupil size analysis, which is only evidence of sympathetic stimulation. Fight or flight activation so it could be from fear, anxiety,anger, whatever. Pupil size can change with emotions. Or maybe she drank a lot of caffeine or a red bull.

GIP is glucose dependent so it's safe as far as lows because it doesn't kick in to lower it unless the blood sugar is high to begin with. Having that second mimetic is a bonus for sugar control but also for weight loss because it dampens ""food noise"" more than just a GLP1. 
On mounjaro I can walk by my favorite desserts and say ""meh""  or just take one bite and be 100% satisfied. It's awesome! Not to say I don't still enjoy sweet stuff because I still do but I tend to gravitate now towards ""fresh"" desserts like fresh  strawberries with a bit of whip cream instead of say rich cake or something.

me5ygt6,Dr_Mike_Herring,"There are LOADS of layers to this! May be a long response-

The 'eat less' paradigm is indeed accurate, but it's very much oversimplified. A more correct statement it to 'eat fewer calories.' One of my favorite examples is eating 1 pound of strawberries is 150 calories. Eating one serving of peanut butter is 200 calories. So while 1 pound of strawberries is WAY more food than 1 serving of peanut butter, the bucket of strawberries has fewer calories. It's the concept of calorie density-fewer calories per volume of food. One of the reasons I want people to eat mainly whole/minimally processed foods is that it's hard to eat way too many calories with those foods and its VERY easy to over-eat processed foods high in sugar, salt and fat because, well, they're delicious.

As we learn more and more about the drivers of obesity and overeating, there are tons of factors impacting our eating habits. While I don't exactly agree with 'being under attack' from food companies, I do see and agree with the general point-every TV commercial is either fast food or candy because, well, they're businesses and it's really hard to develop a marketing campaign for salmon, broccoli and sweet potatoes.

That brings me to my next point where I find much of the true issue-education.

Long gone are the days where we'd learn about nutrition in schools. I saw a super interesting (to me, a nerd) documentary on school lunches in Japan. Every lunch comes with a nutrition lecture from a dietician to teach the kids about proper nutrition, and everything in the school is made fresh in house, that day. Those kids get a level of education that most of us will never get, and that sets them up for success for their entire lives.

With regards to GLP1 medications, i have never and will never suggest that everyone overweight needs them. I lost 100 pounds about 12 years ago and have managed to keep it off even though i do still struggle with food noise and binge eating, although less so now than when i was 300 pounds. I know very well that sustained weight loss is possible without medication.

That being said, i view these medications as having 2 potential uses:

1. Some people will need a boost. These medications can lower the barrier of entry to a healthy lifestyle. As people use these medications to lose weight, my hope is that they use that time to re-wire their brains and habits to develop a lifestyle that leads to lifelong health. After time, some people may want to try and wean off the medication (who wants to be on medication? I'm a type 1 diabetic and need insulin to survive, but i still dont like needing/taking medication).

2. More commonly, in many cases, obesity is a chronic illness, not simply a representation of nutritional choices. For whatever reason, perhaps some people don't have the brain signals to stop eating when they've eaten enough (I've got that one, lol), some people may have heightened dopamine responses to ultraprocessed foods (this is *not* the same as addiction, but it can look similar) and many others. I view this kind of like i view blood pressure. If someone comes to clinic with high blood pressure, they may get a medication and get their blood pressure under control. Once that happens, we don't simply stop the medication because then the blood pressure will go back to elevated.

There’s no need for surgery, recovery time, having complications for life, etc. a lot of obese people are also on a time limit to lose the weight or honestly die. Like literally why does it matter how they lose the weight? Why do we have to make people who are overweight feel worse about it, like they HAVE to work it all off otherwise they’re less accomplished and worthy of being ‘skinny’?

It was never a terribly high number I needed to lose, but when you’ve been having a gremlin in the back of your mind telling you you have to get a handle on something like this from age 8 onward, nineteen years of mental torment starts to take a toll. 

This year I finally was able to start seeing results and the main motivator to get it done was putting my own money on the line. Has to be enough money that you will hate breaking your food guidelines but not so much that it will cause you financial problems. 

Might sound crazy to some but this has actually forced me to change my habits. I’ve also gained a healthier perspective on my body image and become much less stressed about it since starting to see some results and getting physically used to eating less. The guidelines I set for myself were also as lenient as possible while still showing results so that I didn’t give up or go hungry. 

Will have to create a longer term plan once I un-obligate myself financially. Still in the process of doing so, still have a bit to go, but the longer I stick with it and the further I get, the more excited and willing I am to continue.

It elevates my mood and makes me want to cook and clean in between the days I play. Losing weight should allow you to make lifestyle changes that will make it easier to keep the weight off.

mc3zyhj,Healthinsuranceaca,"Here’s your corrected text with your latest addition properly integrated:

People are jealous. Why? I know firsthand because of my journey… they say it’s the easy way out or that I’m taking away from people with diabetes. Ironically, peptides are a preventive treatment for just that. They are medically necessary for weight loss and also help with blood pressure, addiction, and much more.

There are a lot of benefits. People need to educate themselves instead of being quick to believe everything they see flashed in their faces on social media. I love America, but the peptide is portrayed in a way that makes people feel scared, uneasy, and bitter—to make people feel just that way—jealous, with a sour taste in their mouth. America makes it so expensive because Big Pharma wants to make money. It costs $7 to buy—I know firsthand. Other countries get it for as low as $50 a month, and some even cheaper.

So, of course, people are going to be bitter, slander, and shame others for taking what they see as “the easy way out.” I had to get gastric sleeve surgery—oh, the “easy way out”—only because I looked bad before, and now they’re jealous because I look bomb. Let me tell you, it was not easy, and it wasn’t just for vanity. I had multiple health problems, one of them being overweight. Since being on this, all of those problems are gone.

Even though I had the sleeve, I’ve pretty much maintained my weight for 10 years. I use it as maintenance—if I have gained 20 pounds, I go back to the regular dosing on Ozempic, and then when I hit my goal weight, I switch back to maintenance.

So carry on, haters. It sucks for you not to take the easy way out. Working smarter, not harder, is better. 💯🎤 Just let that negativity and lack of education whirl through your ears! Get healthy, look good, and maintain I’m all in .

Yes, Ozempic (semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which is a type of peptide-based drug used primarily for managing type 2 diabetes and, more recently, for weight loss.

A peptide is a short chain of amino acids that act as signaling molecules in the body. Ozempic mimics a natural peptide hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which helps regulate blood sugar, appetite, and insulin secretion.

So, while Ozempic is technically a peptide-based drug, it is still classified as a pharmaceutical medication rather than a pure peptide supplement.

The peptide in Ozempic (semaglutide) is synthetically made using recombinant DNA technology. It is designed to mimic the naturally occurring GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone in the body.

How is it made?
	1.	Produced in a Lab: Scientists use genetically modified yeast or bacterial cells (commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce semaglutide.
	2.	DNA Insertion: The genetic code for GLP-1 is altered to create a longer-lasting version (semaglutide) and inserted into the yeast/bacteria.
	3.	Fermentation Process: These microorganisms then produce the peptide in large quantities.
	4.	Purification: The peptide is extracted, purified, and modified for stability, ensuring it lasts longer in the body compared to natural GLP-1.
	5.	Final Formulation: The purified peptide is combined with stabilizers and delivered in an injectable form like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Rybelsus (oral form).

Because of this process, semaglutide is not a naturally derived peptide but a lab-engineered synthetic peptide-based drug designed to function like GLP-1 in the human body.",1739238964.0,1,t3_1gh8oh6,0,1,0
luyoac9,M00seManiac,"The risks of these medications for non-diabetics are astonomically higher than you appreciate or most people hear about. The risk of taking this medication is that you will never be able to enjoy food again for the rest of your life. It is also not just a side effect while you're taking it, but a permanent condition that persists after you come off. No more Thanksgiving, no more potlucks, no Christmas dinner with the family. At best, you get to watch them eat while you have special bland mashed potatoes and a protein shake. At worst, you're on a feeding tube and can't have food or drink orally ever again. You will be constantly nauseated, barely able to hold down liquids on some days, and in extreme agony if you eat a trigger food. This condition is called gastoparesis (translates to stomach paralysis) and is a condition I've personally been struggling with for over a decade due to an unknown cause.

This risk is considered acceptable for diabetic patients because diabetes can ALSO cause gastoparesis if it is uncontrolled, so they're already at risk. That was an absolutely critical consideration as part of the FDA approval. The drugs are absolutely NOT safe for anyone without diabetes risks because of this side effect alone and should not be used casually for weight loss. Many are trying to claim that a ""risk"" of developing diabetes from being obese is enough, but unless you're showing signs of ""pre-diabetes,"" it is not.

Gastoparesis is incurable with limited treatment options, which are either surgery or a medication called Reglan that has a ""black box"" for a side effect of permanent uncontrollable muscle spasms. They also don't always get you ""normal,"" and it can be more ""not dying from malnutrition."" Many patients taking GLP-1s ignore the initial signs because feeling full quickly and being a little nauseous helps them lose weight, and they assume it will go away once they come off it. It doesn't, and they caused permanent damage by not stopping immediately.

Gastoparesis has moved from a ""rare"" disease to ""uncommon"" because of the recent massive increase in patients. It's so common from these new meds that it's already become the default presumed cause for non-diabetic patients. I'm constantly explaining to doctors I've had it before it ""became cool."" Also, fun fact, many people end up gaining weight long term with gastoparesis because of dietary restrictions and metabolism issues it causes. So you are not only risking permanently disabling your stomach but being fat again at the end of it. 

No ""quick win"" comes without risks, and weight loss is an off-label use that has NOT been found to be safe by the by the FDA. Your assumption that the side effects are not as bad as being obese is completely false. They are far worse, and the fact that our society is all too quick to brush them entirely under the rug to promote these drugs instead of addressing the underlying causes of obesity is an even bigger problem. Deciding that losing the ability to eat for the rest of your life is an appropriate risk to take because you got fat is inherently wrong, and you deserve better.",1730515662.0,1,t3_1gh8oh6,0,1,0

lv2ertz,TerryMisery,"&gt; Unless we put millions of people on ozympic forever, eventually, they need to learn how to maintain their weight without it.

What you're talking about is good for prevention, and not even for everyone, as people have underlying conditions making avoiding weight gain next to impossible, unless they turn their whole lives to a weight gain prevention programmes.

Obesity causes both reversible and irreversible changes in the body. Some people had those specific changes before they became obese, and they contributed greatly to future weight gain, e.g. insulin resistance.

Being fit after being obese is NOT THE SAME as always being fit. It's much harder, your body will reduce its energy expenditure (limiting your strength, thermogenesis, causing feeling of tiredness) and produce more hunger signals, if you lose weight. Weight loss drugs, especially tirzepatide and retatrutide, that work on a broader set of receptors, revert this state back to normal. Your body stops feeling and acting like it's starving. Energy expenditure goes back to the baseline, food-craze in one's head calms down. To make it clear, I'm not saying this effect is unbearable for everyone.

Why would affected people have to live without a medication, that makes their bodies function normally again? What you said in that sentence makes the same sense for obesity as for depression, hypertension, osteoarthritis, etc. Sure you can adjust your life to accommodate special needs and put extra effort, having lower quality of life.

Here's how I've done it after being a fat kid in high school who still likes to eat like a fat kid. I track my calories on an app. I know I need around 2500 a day to lose weight.

When the pancreas quits entirely, that’s Type 1 diabetes. If it’s not working as well as it should, it’s T2d. 

Sometimes the pancreas and liver don’t work well together and you can have things like liver dumping, in which the liver determines glucose level is going down - not necessarily severely - and releases all the stored glucose at once. So after “fasting” while asleep, liver go bzzzt and you wake up with high glucose. 

It can get fairly complicated.

lumc3va,Zealousideal-Ring300,"Maybe read the very next comment by a surgeon agreeing with them. Also if you know good doctors, you know claiming something that’s still actively being researched is a fact is horseshit. Show me definitive peer reviewed meta analyses over long periods of time, with very large sample sizes and we’ll talk. 

Anyway, ER docs need to get people in and out as fast as possible. If you’re not actively dying, follow up with your doctor or “come back if it gets worse.” They’re pretty well known for grasping at whatever conclusion gets you out the door. 

No hate for ER docs bc they are incredibly busy, and most people who show up don’t have emergent issues. If you do, they need time to work with you and get you admitted if necessary, so they have to blow through the triage &amp; turf patients to make time for the true emergencies. 

P.S. Where did you acquire your MD? jk I know you don’t have one. Neither do I, but I DO have lots of friends who do, and lots of chronic illnesses so I’m in the ER fairly often. Last time I broke 2 toes and just wanted to be sure I set the displaced one properly. 

I told the doc how I reduced the fracture and both the doctor and nurse thought I was in the medical field. I just have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos so I can take care of sprains, breaks, deep lacerations, etc. I’m used to a certain level of pain so I don’t piss about. Saw the baby toe pointed out at 45 degrees halfway down the digit, and reset it. I hate waiting in ERs if I can do it myself. Safely, that is.

I continued to have GERD (at one time it was Barrett's), IBS , colon polyps removals, NAFL, and all kinds of issues with diverticulosis pockets, stomach pain, gastritis attacks.  Started Ozempic about a year ago (off and on for a while in the beginning)- still have gastro issues - landed me in ER recently.  They have also tested for H. Pylori through endoscopy, negative.  I was losing weight and on really high protein, which could have triggered it.  I notice seeds/nuts are a no for me-and I have found a better balance on protein (I lift/strenght trainining) without going overboard.  I notice 24hs after a new dose I have really bad upper stomach pain - it levels out over the next few days.  

My GI dr is convinced it's the ozempic, but I know I had a lot of issues prior to it- and it's saving my life with the improved A1C at normal levels now. I think the issues now are related to high levels of long-term PPI use.  So now I only take as needed instead of 40mg daily.   Ozempic DOES seem to aggravate symptoms somewhat, especially the slower digestion and still sometimes sulfur burbs, etc...-so it's not blameless, but not the full cause either. My hold dads side of the family had similar GI/colon issues-so genetics can play a role.  I also have been under severe stress for quite some time, and I know it plays a huge role in my stomach problems- so eating healthier and losing weight is helping-I think it's just something I have to deal with for life.

I found that daily weigh-ins help prevent freak outs. If my weight is up 2lbs in a day, I know it's just water and it'll come right back off.

I went back to Ozempic, because Mounjaro went out of stock and I couldn't get it at any pharmacy within 50 miles of me.

Neither really does anything for me.  I get no side effects, my blood sugar hasn't improved, and I haven't lost any weight.  I'm at the 1 mg dose, and I'm goign up to the 2 mg dose in a few weeks.

Diet works way better than any medicine I take, at least for me. I stay on the drugs because my insurance and my doctor's health conglomorate require I be on some kind of medication, since my blood sugar is not in normal range. But with keto, I can stay below 140 100% of the time, usually below 120. Without keto but on Metformin + Ozempic + Lantus I'm lucky to get below 200.

Although both of these things have pretty small effects and it mostly really is just about how much calories you consume, regardless of what or when.

Ultimately, laws of nature dictate it is in fact as simple as calories in vs calories out, but all the things that determine what your calories in and your calories out is is pretty complicated and impossible to measure completely accurately.

lnw2ypw,C4LYPSONE,"The issue here is that obesity is a chronic and relapsing disease, and not some temporary state that's easily reversible. If obesity was shown to have a reliable way of reversal via lifestyle changes, I'd be inclined to agree with you. However, the reality is that the remission rate post-weight loss is astronomically high. 

The only thing that has even managed to put a dent in the American obesity rate, is Ozempic. If Ozempic did not address the root cause, it wouldn't be as effective as it is. Conversely, if lifestyle changes were the answer, it would be much more effective than it is.

Chronic diseases should absolutely be treated like chronic diseases. We don't tell someone with psychosis to take antipsychotics until they're better, and then take them off them. Similarly, we don't tell someone with familiar hypercholesterolemia to take statins until it's lowered, and then cut them off them. We realize that because their conditions are chronic, they should be taking it long-term. Obesity is no exception. 

Dietary changes is unironically the ""quick fix"" that's surface-level, whereas GLP-1 medications attack the source of the problem -- hunger, which is dysregulated in people with obesity. There's also some very interesting research that suggests these medications may have long-term, beneficial effects even after quitting them.

lnredqg,dcgregoryaphone,"In my world, ""starving"" in the sense you're using it (as opposed to saying you're ""starving because you haven't eaten in a few hours"") means suffering from malnourishment which will lead to death. That's not what is happening to someone who is obese on a 1k calorie diet. Please define what your idea of starving is.

You're also way off on how many calories morbidly obese people need.  It really depends on their activity level, which likely isn't very high, because they're morbidly obese.  As they lose weight, they may regain some mobility, but if they don't supplement protein and exercise they'll lose some of the muscle mass that they needed to carry around their weight. But just saying an obese person needs 2000-2500 calories per day is nonsense without knowing what they do.

Edited to add: one thing you need to understand is that the entire reason ""weight loss"" or ""fat"" is a thing at all, is because your body can convert fat into energy. When you take in less, your body relies on what it has stored. This is different than your needed nutrient intake of vitamins, minerals, protein, etc, which you can sufficiently achieve with supplementation even with low food intake.",1726678934.0,-1,t1_lnr083t,4,-1,0

Failure of the government by allowing companies to effectively poison us, push products to make people addicted to unhealthy food, and run campaigns to obfuscate the ill effects to the public.

If you are fat it is partly your fault, and partly the fault of our system. That said, weight loss drugs do nothing to solve either of those problems. Even if you lose weight artificially, you are likely still consuming trash food that is wreaking havoc on your body because you didn’t learn the lifestyle changes necessary to consume healthy food. You likely are not going to start working out either because why would you? People will say “I would work out if I lost weight” but you can work out now.

luvt3nu,Intelligent-Bad7835,"You kinda lost me at ""anti-fatphobia crowd,"" why are you letting people who don't think it's good to be so overweight it takes decades off your life span influence your thinking at all? Those people are delusional morons, and the advice they are giving *will* kill you if you follow it. Heart disease kills one in five Americans. You, your doctor, and actual medical textbooks and other actual medical professionals are the only people who should be involved in decisions about what medicines you take.

Side effects of Ozempic include:

* Breathing problems or wheezing.
* Racing heart.
* Fever or general ill feeling.
* Swollen lymph nodes.
* Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue, or throat.
* Trouble swallowing or throat tightness.
* Itching, skin rash, or pale red bumps on the skin called hives.
* Nausea or vomiting.

These are side effects we know about. They are very well documented. There are others, but they're less severe or much much less common, this is the list you need to worry about. As you say, being obese also has side effects you are quite familiar with, so you're in a position to decide which is worse. But there is something in inherently wrong with losing weight via drugs, they have side affects, and you can develop dependency on them. The benefit may be worth these problems, but they are for sure problems. So, there are two unavoidable core categories of things inherently wrong with taking Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs, ignoring availability and supply and demand. This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad decision for you to take the drugs, and to become dependent on them, but dependency and side effects are inherent problems when you rely on drugs to control your wieght.

. You seem convinced you can't lose weight ""the right way,"" and you're turning to drugs instead, so that means you see the drugs as the ""wrong"" way on some level. I don't know what you've tried, but I do know morbid obesity will decrease the duration of your life while also decreasing the quality. And, if you try the pills and find the side effects worse than you thought they were, you can go off them, right? It seems like you're looking at this like you only have two choices: be morbidly obese until you die young, or take this drug. These aren't your only choices, you have other options to explore.

I had a friend in pretty much your position, who felt like he couldn't lose weight, felt embarrassed about going outside in public, so he started only going outside after dark and eating lots of delivery. As soon as he decided it wasn't possible for him to lose weight, he started gaining weight rapidly. You may feel like your efforts aren't helping, but giving up on them entirely is almost certainly worse than what you're currently doing. Yoni took only 18 months to go from 350 to 500 pounds. He didn't live long after he hit 600. He was 26. He was funny, kind, generous, a really good friend - I wish he'd taken drugs instead of dying.

You could make no changes to your diet and non-work lifestyle and get a full time manual labor heavy lifting job. It will hurt at first, but you'll get paid, and I've always been more able to do hard, unpleasant things if I'm getting paid. For me, this is probably the easiest way to control my weight, I'm the sort of person who loves to throw myself hard into physical projects. I hate going to the doctor. I'm not good at consistently taking pills. I knew a couple huge guys in high school who lost 20 pounds a month doing stuff like digging ditches and moving boats. I also know a morbidly obese guy who did lots of heavy manual labor but just ate more worse food and kept gaining weight. He claimed he couldn't control his portions because he had ADHD, which I was always dubious of.

I don't know the specifics of your diet and your metabolism, but there are lots of changes you can make there as well, and there are ways to do it that work for you. For many people, eliminating sugary drinks helps a lot. If you have the fortune to have good health insurance, that comes with a mental health benefit. I don't know if therapy would help you lose weight, but it sounds like it might and there are very few people who *don't* benefit from a therapist.

I know you asked us to ignore supply and demand, but we live in a capitalist society and it affects *everything*. If you have good enough health insurance and finances that you can ignore the cost when you're looking at an expensive drug, they you have good enough health insurance and finances to thoroughly explore other options. You don't have to do this alone, get help, it sounds like you can't afford to not get help.",1730480034.0,-4,t3_1gh8oh6,0,-4,0
