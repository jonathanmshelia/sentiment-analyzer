GIP is glucose dependent so it's safe as far as lows because it doesn't kick in to lower it unless the blood sugar is high to begin with. Having that second mimetic is a bonus for sugar control but also for weight loss because it dampens \"food noise\" more than just a GLP1. \nOn mounjaro I can walk by my favorite desserts and say \"meh\"  or just take one bite and be 100% satisfied. It's awesome! Not to say I don't still enjoy sweet stuff because I still do but I tend to gravitate now towards \"fresh\" desserts like fresh  strawberries with a bit of whip cream instead of say rich cake or something.\nI'm not diabetic but was pre-diabetic with an A1C of 6.3 and now back to completely normal A1C and that's just the starting dose of 2.5mg for a month! Going up to 5mg next week and if it has good weight loss then will likely not go higher. I have about 25-30lbs to lose to be back to my early 20s weight of mid 120s lbs. I'm 49 now for reference so perimenopause is a thing and contributes to weight gain AND blood sugar rising. So mounjaro is counteracting it :)",
