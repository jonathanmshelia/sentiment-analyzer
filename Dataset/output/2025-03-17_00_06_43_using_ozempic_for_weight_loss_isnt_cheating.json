A) any form of weight loss, including eating healthy and working out, is rapidly reversed when you stop. B) most people actually don\u2019t relapse when they stop taking Semaglutides at all. \n\nMy wife took it from about July 2023 to January 2024 and lost 50 pounds. Going from 165 to 115 pounds. She hasn\u2019t taken it since then and is at 117 pounds. We eat pretty mediocre diets and don\u2019t workout much. The drug is just super effective because it both blocks your digestive system from absorbing Fats, Calories, cholesterol, etc. But it\u2019s even more effective because it retrains you to eat small portions and less meals overall. These habits stay when you get off the medication.\n\nMost people that use these medications do so because they\u2019re drastically at rock bottom and just getting up and creating a routine of eating extremely healthy and working out post 30 has extremely low returns, causing people more often than not to quit. This drug is extremely effective at the bare minimum as a kickstart to what\u2019s an overall very unhealthy populace in America.

If obesity was shown to have a reliable way of reversal via lifestyle changes, I'd be inclined to agree with you. However, the reality is that the remission rate post-weight loss is astronomically high. \n\nThe only thing that has even managed to put a dent in the American obesity rate, is Ozempic. If Ozempic did not address the root cause, it wouldn't be as effective as it is. Conversely, if lifestyle changes were the answer, it would be much more effective than it is.\n\nChronic diseases should absolutely be treated like chronic diseases. We don't tell someone with psychosis to take antipsychotics until they're better, and then take them off them. Similarly, we don't tell someone with familiar hypercholesterolemia to take statins until it's lowered, and then cut them off them. We realize that because their conditions are chronic, they should be taking it long-term. Obesity is no exception. \n\nDietary changes is unironically the \"quick fix\" that's surface-level, whereas GLP-1 medications attack the source of the problem -- hunger, which is dysregulated in people with obesity. There's also some very interesting research that suggests these medications may have long-term, beneficial effects even after quitting them. It seems that people regain more weight when they lose it \"the traditional way\", than when they do it with Ozempic (but later quit).",

Washing clothes, sweeping floors, maintaining comfort required a level of physical input that we have designed around. Cars, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dish washers, lawn mowers, etc. have all made life easier and require less sweat equity (and we continue to make things lighter and more automated).\n\nProcessed foods with high quantities of fats sugars were rare and generally more expensive than the raw components for previous generations. Food companies have tested specific metrics on how sweet/fat something can be to be the most addictive to our monkey brains and corn subsidies has totally changed the American diet. Combine that with the massive convenience of drive through pre-cooked meals. They\u2019re designed to stimulate the wiring that was designed over millennia to encourage necessary fat storage for survival. We are not designed for abundance, especially abundance with little to no nutritive value. Resisting the urge to just grab something quick also requires either planning ahead or massive amounts of intention to override the internal programming.\n\nMovement to and from places used to require a lot more physicality. We prioritized a highway system over public transportation. We built sprawling suburbs with nary a town center or grocery store in sight. We centralized city planning around cars and parking and not around people.\n\nThe obesity epidemic is the culmination and unintentional consequence of a race for profit built on the reward centers in our brains. Sure, people can overcome their internal programming, spend hours planning so they can have healthy choices as easily as they have unhealthy ones and do all of this ahead of decision fatigue so they\u2019re not as tempted by the cheap, easy, convenient thing\u2026 and that requires the ability to shop for and prepare food ahead of time.  It\u2019s not a moral failing when they don\u2019t have that capacity. It\u2019s also true that there are people who simply do not struggle as much with these challenges because of brain chemistry and physiology. There are genetic components that can be triggered by previous generations that will impact germ cells.\n\nAll of this to say if there are medication interventions that help with satiety, that gently \u201cshush\u201d the parts of our genetic code designed to survive famine (and incidentally have shown some other truly interesting results in impulse control for non-food related addiction such as alcohol in addition to some fascinating results with plaque buildup in the brain) I say do what is right for you knowing there\u2019s risk. Our inventiveness as a species in the area of calorie procurement and distribution has outpaced our evolutionary incentives, so logically until evolution can catch up (or we radically change the structure of society) utilizing another tool for prolonging survival seems logical to me.",

It really depends on their activity level, which likely isn't very high, because they're morbidly obese.  As they lose weight, they may regain some mobility, but if they don't supplement protein and exercise they'll lose some of the muscle mass that they needed to carry around their weight. But just saying an obese person needs 2000-2500 calories per day is nonsense without knowing what they do.\n\nEdited to add: one thing you need to understand is that the entire reason \"weight loss\" or \"fat\" is a thing at all, is because your body can convert fat into energy. When you take in less, your body relies on what it has stored. This is different than your needed nutrient intake of vitamins, minerals, protein, etc, which you can sufficiently achieve with supplementation even with low food intake.",

Combination of sleep disorders with stress and depression already put me at a disadvantage when it comes to weight management. \n\nI struggled with extreme food insecurity as a child and was malnourished most of my life under the age of 18 and even most of my adult life (I'm 24) due to being homeless for a period of time and lack of income because of COVID. Studies have proven that poverty and food insecurity is a big factor in the obesity problem in my country (I'm in the US). I also come from a long line of overweight people who have conditions that make it difficult to lose weight. I am immunocompromised, insulin resistant, and have hormone disorders like PCOS.",
