I never went back to maintenance calories during the 2 years or so it took me to do that.  Personally, the biggest problem I have seen with people, and weight loss, is they want it to happen far too quickly.   So they do a deficit that is much too large to sustain over the long run.   It is possible that with Ozempic the same thing is happening especially if you were very big to begin with.   They will see much larger loss initially from water weight, reconfiguration and then expect that the weight will continue to come off at that speed.   So they push far too hard.   In my experience weight never comes off in a linear manner on a scale.  Fat loss at 500 calorie deficit will be 1 pound a week but water weight and other things will shift far quicker than that.   So it is easily masked by other changes.   So people see a 1 or 2 week hold at a specific weight and think they are not losing when it just takes time for that to continue to be registered on a scale.",

Further to that, below 20% bf my metabolism just adapts pretty quick too, after 2-3 weeks at like a 350 calorie deficit my resting heart rate can drop like 12-15 BPM. Above that 20% bf number, I personally didn't see much concern even at like a 1000 kcal deficit for several months. But as I get to around 15% bf or below - my metabolic adaptation just sky rockets.\n\n\nI find I have the most success cutting when I keep the deficit to around 350-500 calories for about 3 weeks, and then spend 3-4 days in a caloric surplus of around 500 kcals. When I don't do that, I find my metabolism just tanks and even if I'm only trying to drop like 5-10 lbs after the initial loss of water/glycogen, my TDEE quickly becomes like 1500-1800 kcal within about 6-8 weeks. But if I do the 3-4 days of a surplus, my TDEE will stay in the 2500-2800 kcal range.\n\n\nObviously trying to stay at a 500 kcal deficit when you're only eating 1000 kcal a day is... Awful. Trying to do it at 2300 kcal a day is relatively easy. But I think I just drew the short straw there and a lot of people don't get near that level of metabolic adaptation.",

As you can see from the original article and studies, those people DID significantly increase their exercise and DID significantly reduce their calorie intake and their bodies amped up the hormones anyways.  The ones who did \"best\" are the ones who didn't deviate as far from their original weight, resulting in a less powerful metabolic adaptation / overcorrection.",

First of all, I don't know if this is just unfortunate phrasing, but to clarify of course fat tissue doesn't literally turn into muscle tissue. \n\nThe other thing is that you lose fat a _lot_ faster than you can gain muscle. Leaving aside drugs, if you diligently train for hypertrophy you'd be lucky to gain 10lbs of muscle in a year \u2014 if you had low muscle mass before and you're genetically gifted maybe as much as 20lbs in your first year of training, but that's _very_ optimistic. Whereas you can easily lose in excess of 50lbs of fat even if you're not on a particularly strict diet. More so if you're morbidly obese or you're on a bit more extreme diet. \n\nIf you're actually overweight, and you train and diet at the same time, yes you will gain some weight from muscles and lose some weight from fat. But your weight should still be going down overall, and the weight gain from muscles should be more or less a rounding error. You're simply not putting on so much mass so quickly, otherwise everyone who managed to semi-consistently hit the gym would look like a fitness influencer. Like if you're 6'1 weighing 220lbs to begin with, it's kinda ridiculous to try to maintain that weight if you're trying to lose fat \u2014 if you're lean at that weight and height you're basically a pro bodybuilder already.",

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125000221\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nSDU researchers have discovered a new way in which the liver regulates its consumption of sugar and fat. This could potentially increase the effectiveness of weight-loss and diabetes medication.\n\nMany people who have tried to lose weight by cutting calories are familiar with this frustrating reality: at some point, the body stops shedding pounds. It senses the reduced calorie intake and responds by slowing down metabolism, causing it to burn fewer calories than before the diet.\n\nThis happens because the body perceives a potential starvation threat and adapts by conserving energy while still carrying out essential functions.\n\nIt may seem incredibly unfair that the body doesn\u2019t recognize the goal of weight loss and instead works against it by holding on to calories.\n\nNow, a new Danish study has identified a possible way to maintain calorie burning even when consuming fewer calories. This discovery could be particularly important for patients using weight-loss or diabetes medicines like Wegovy and Ozempic. Many people taking these medications find that their weight loss plateaus after losing about 20-25% of their body weight.\n\nAccording to Kim Ravnskjaer, a Principal Investigator and associate professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, this stall is likely due to the body's natural response.\n\nIt usually goes well at first, but as people lose some of the weight they aim to shed, their progress stalls because the body\u2019s metabolism adapts, he says.\n\nIf it were possible to control this metabolic adaptation, it could be a game-changer for anyone trying to lose weight. A medication that could counteract this effect might extend the benefits of treatments like Wegovy, which often stop working after a certain point. This is where the new study by Kim Ravnskjaer and colleagues\u2014 published in the prestigious journal Cell Metabolism \u2014comes into play.\n\nIf we could develop a medication that helps maintain fat or sugar burning at its original high level alongside weight-loss treatments, people could continue losing weight beyond the usual plateau, he explains.\n\nThe researchers' discovery was unexpected when they were investigating the function of a gene called Plvap in certain liver cells in mice. The team knew from previous studies that humans born without this gene have problems with their lipid metabolism, a connection the research team set out to investigate.\n\nIt turned out that the Plvap gene enables the body\u2019s metabolic shift from burning sugar to fat when fasting. And when Plvap is turned off \u2013 as the researchers did in their laboratory mice \u2013 the liver does not recognize that the body is fasting and continues burning sugar.",

Whenever I'm trying to cut a few lbs I use refeed days where I eat a little above my maintenance once or twice a week while maintaining a 200-300 calorie deficit the rest of the days. This generally prevents the metabolism from slowing down as much as well as giving you a day where you can replenish sugars and nutrients you might be depleted in.\n\nPeople need to recognize our bodies are designed to adapt so we need to account for that.
