I\u2019m moving to .5 at my next appointment in a week ish. to try to get my mini spikes out. My 30 day average sugar is 113. My A1C was 7.9 last month so big difference so far. I\u2019ve lost about 8 pounds and then stayed flat. My big side effect has been a bit of heartburn every now and again. \n\nI was originally on 1000 Metformin (500 mg 2 times a day) and could tolerate it. Before the Ozempic, my doc upped my Metformin to 2000 and HELLS NO! It was awful. So we added Ozempic and downed Metformin back to the OG dose \ud83e\udd23.  I\u2019m hoping I can cut it down more when Oz goes up. \n\nI am a picky eater eater too, OP. I make sure I have protein and veggies or a salad as much as possible for anything else. I like to snack on almonds and sunflower seeds (so much fun to eat \ud83e\udd23). I can now tolerate bread!!! So a sandwich for lunch is back in the realm of possibility. I couldn\u2019t eat bread or rice ever before. Now I can in small quantities. \n\nI\u2019m on track to have an A1C at or below 6 according to my CGM. I think back to my dad who was a barely controlled type 2. He tried, meds, insulin\u2026. This medication or something similar would have been a game changer for him.",
