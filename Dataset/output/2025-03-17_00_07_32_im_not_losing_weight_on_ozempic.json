        "body": "First, let me start by saying I'm not a Dr or fitness guru. Yet, I have been learning a lot recently on my journey. Here are my thoughts on the subject. \n\nIf Ozempic is bringing down your BS, great! That is exactly what is supposed to happen. Another thing that happens, is the meds like Ozempic suppress your appetite. So it sounds like you've been successful with changing your eating habits and I'd assume Ozempic has assisted with your cravings and such to help you cut carbs etc. Again, doing what it's supposed to do. That said, the Ozempic doesn't need a jump start. It seems to be doing exactly what it is intended to do. \n\nWhat needs a jumpstart to losing weight is your metabolism! (This is where I'm struggling at the moment also) when we consume less calories over time, our body adjust (lowers) our Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). I recommend you eat more protien (which is why keto is giving results) and start some strength training to build muscle. This will raise your BMR and your body will start to burn more fat. You may gain some weight at 1st but it be muscle. A smart scale will help show you if your fat is dropping while muscle mass is increasing. In other words, your composition may change and it will ultimately lead to fat loss. \n\nAnother method for boosting the metabolism is Intermittent Fasting (IF). This is tricky for us diabetics. But IF is the next step on my journey. It looks promising. Join that sub reddit also. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lEXdbH3-weQ?si=FGoF2Q7DnQrKYob9 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/8RuWp3s6Uxk?si=o-G63M65u3tmb0Gm",

These medications have starter doses, and it often takes several titrations up to get to a therapeutic dose for weightloss.\n\n2. Have you lost any weight? Sometimes we think we\u2019re not doing well, but a half a pound a week is a healthy amount of loss and since the main target for the drug is to lower blood sugar, many people stay on doses that work for that so weight loss is only about 10-15lbs. \n\n3. Are you tracking calories? Many of us do because you have to be in a calorie deficit for weight loss. If you are over or UNDER eating, you will not lose weight. The medication isn\u2019t causing the weight loss, the calorie deficit from the appetite suppression is what causes the weight loss. \n\n4. How\u2019s your muscle mass? Muscle has a lot to do with metabolism and if you\u2019ve lost any, you\u2019re going to struggle. Now is a great time to do things that will build your muscles.\n\n5. How\u2019s your overall diet? Build your meals around lean protein and eat lots of vegetables. I\u2019d personally avoid keto and go back to a sustainable mix of foods that keep you in a calorie deficit.\n\n6. Consider switching to Mounjaro. This is actually really common as it seems to be more effective in lowering blood sugar and aiding the weightloss.",

Not only that, the average weight loss is only about 15 to 20 percent of your body weight so it won't be a significant loss for most people. It can also take longer than normal weight loss. And lastly, Ozempic and other similar products have only been proven to spur weight loss in conjunction with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. So loss may not be as effective without those changes.",

I had a failed fusion which left me in horrible pain to the point I had to stop working and focus on my health.    I started walking around my apartment building and now up to a couple miles per day.   I decided anything to help my back which in turn will somewhat maybe giving me a better future.   I wasn't fulling planning on a FDL TT, but  honestly it was the best.   I didn't realize just how F$%&amp;end up my recti muscles were.  It was severe. I am AMAZED to have stomach muscles that work!!    Ozempic is not a quick fix,  if that is what you want, you maybe disappointed.  I still struggle and am working on finding a maintenance dose that works for me.  \n I would add pics if I could.\n\nTo reiterate   I had 2 years of number improving with little weight loss then the weight literally dropped off.   I do believe that was do to an anxiety med that would cause me to binge eat late at night. It was about that time life happened.  Lots of trauma including my Mom being DX with cancer for the last time.  I know the 40 days I was home with her in hospice I lost  25 lbs.  Then I was loosing 10 to 15 lbs every couple weeks.    \n\nAll off my numbers are within normal range for the first time.   Last 3 A1c,  4.7 - 4.9 range from 10.7.  BMI 39 down  27.  Size 22 to 8.
