        "body": "u/Effective_League_205 , any update on your progress? \n\nI am a 41 year old, been T1 for about 30 years, and have become extremely insulin resistant.  I am taking about 150 units per day (2.5 u/hour basal, 1:6 carb ratio).  For the past 3 years, I have been experiencing the same exercise issue you have.  I can be sitting all day at work, fighting to keep my sugar below 200.  As soon as I do any physical activity, my sugar will start to plummet, as if the insulin on board was jump started to work.  I am currently on metaphomine to help with resistance, but I cannot tell if it does anything.  I am currently on the T Slim Pump with a G6 dexcom.  I use the IQ control, which automates some bolus' if I need them.  But still, the control IQ cannot keep up.  So I do a correction bolus and it makes a small difference.  Sometimes I will take a brisk 30 min walk when my sugar wont come down, and I have quite a bit of Insulin On Board (IOB), and that seems to trigger it to start to come down.  \n\nSo, I have been thinking about talking to my Endo about either Mounjaro, or Ozempic.  As it appears my insurance (HAP) will cover those medications.  But of course, like you I am afraid of severe hypos, as my sugar levels are also on a rollercoaster.  ITs a balance between amount of insulin and my activity level.  \n\nJust wondering how it is going for you as it seems we have similar concerns.",

I take less insulin overall and the sharp spikes after eating have evened out. With a Dexcom sensor my lows have not been noticeably worse, just make sure you\u2019re using liquid to treat your low sugars as the food has a delayed response.

Having to calibrate twice a day is also brutal. Sometimes I think that because of my high sensitive to exercise the pump gets used to my baseline needs then it ends up over correcting. It\u2019s only been 3 months so I\u2019m still hopeful.",

It's pretty expensive even with insurance, but I am loving the Omnipod and Dexcom G6.\nOne thing I wish I knew when I got my pump, Tegaderm waterproof patches are great for either covering up when going in water or for using as extra tape when something starts failling off because the natural stick is going bad.",
