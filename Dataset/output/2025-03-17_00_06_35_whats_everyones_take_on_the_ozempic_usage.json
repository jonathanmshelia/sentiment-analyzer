Minimal side effects after the first 3 months of nausea and fatigue. You\u2019ll have to pry my Zepbound out of my cold dead hands. They give you an off switch and mental peace from the food noise. \n\nSome people will have severe side effects, some people won\u2019t respond, and some will eat and drink past the meds. But I truly believe these drugs are a miracle for the majority of user.\n\nMe personally I am no longer pre diabetic, my NAFLD gone, I no longer take blood pressure medication, my cholesterol is normal, and I have significantly decreased my risk for a heart attack and stroke. My endocrinologist says I have added 15 years to my life. \n\nMy brother the diabetic is on Mounjaro. His A1C is normal for the first time in 20 years. He has only lost 15 lbs cause he likes to eat past the meds and drink too much whiskey.\n\nMy younger sister who started 100 lbs heavier than I is at the beginning of her journey. 3 months in she says she never wants to live without her GLP 1 regardless of weight loss because the end of the food noise has brought her more peace than she has ever had.\n\nNon of us have experienced a side effect needing medical care. We as nurses don\u2019t see the whole story we only see the problems. Please have an open mind about these drugs, they truly are the miracle we have been waiting for since the disaster of Phen -Fen (which I also tried in the 90\u2019s and all I can say is it felt like being on speed) Taking a GLP is not the same. I am just me but without the uncontrollable need to eat,eat,eat.",

I refused gastric bypass b/c I've been an RN 25 years and seen too many complications. I've changed to healthier eating habits and walking more. BOTTOM  LINE: I unfortunately still battle IIH and still remain on Diamox. If you do a research literature search you will quickly find that weight loss does not work to cure IIH for everyone. That is just the first thing they like to suggest because it is the most noninvasive. However, my team of\nspecialists now say having smaller transverse sinuses in my brain most likely is the contributing factor causing my IH.\nTurns out since I was diagnosed, my 77 year old mother was found to also have small transverse sinuses and she only weighs 128 lbs. Has suffered with severe head pains - not migraines or tension headaches all her life. Also, my 2nd cousin was found to have a chari malformation and small transverse sinuses - has IIH, takes Diamox, and is male and very physically fit and has never been overweight. Just throwing this out there. Do I regret losing the weight. Heck no! But was so hoping the debilitating IIH symptoms would leave along with the weight loss.",

People on these medications who suffer with overeating tend to have other addictive behaviors as well: social media, gambling, shopping, drinking.  Some reported that when their appetites were curbed by these medications, they found their other addictive behaviors curbed as well. \n\n2. Some in our society are quick to shame those who are overweight\u2014as opposed to the food deserts and addictive foods (chips, soda, candy, fast food, etc) that actively FEED those addictions. Added to that, because being overweight has a visual stigma attached to it, people can SEE their addiction and they are more likely to be stigmatized because of it (more so than someone else who might have a gambling or shopping addiction, for instance, that is not as surface level/noticeable). \n\n3. Body positivity vs. body shaming. These patients walk such a fine line\u2014they feel as though society hates them for being overweight, but then the FEW people who actually supported their body positivity turn on them if they DO lose weight.  They literally are in a catch 22\u2013and in almost all instances, it\u2019s not out of a concern for their health, but unrealistic beauty standards (that now we ALL face thanks to filters and AI).  \n\nIt\u2019s a hard topic, but informed consent and shared decision making is always my go-to, clinically speaking (I don\u2019t actually prescribe these meds myself, just for clarification\u2014I\u2019m in Urgent Care and have no way to monitor them. But because of my location, I do encounter many patients daily who are taking them).",

A LOT of obese people have a malfunctioning hormonal response to food, which makes them simply not feel satiated as easily. A lot also don\u2019t eat non stop like the stereotype is. \n\nTake myself for example. In a fairly normal eater, but I definitely don\u2019t feel full easily, and have almost always been significantly overweight. My wife, on the other hand, eats WAAY more than I do, and is a tiny little thing. To the point it has become a bit of a running joke with her mother\u2019s concern about how little I eat when visiting. \n\nNow, in the past, I\u2019ve had success losing weight with apps like weight watchers. However, I never would feel like I had eaten enough, so I was basically constantly miserable. As a result, the minute I started militantly tracking my input, I\u2019d start to gain weight back. I\u2019d usually plateau somewhere between 250 and 260 lb, though I don\u2019t really look badly obese (I carry it weirdly, primarily in thighs and butt, so my torso looks fairly normal).\n\nQueue trying out ozempic. The first few weeks, I was careful to supplement my diet with protein powder, because I just felt satiated so easily. I would (and still do) routinely get about half way through a meal, and then just feel full, and put it away. Before id just keep eating until the food was gone, and still feel like I could eat more, which I attenuated by just not making as much. With the ozempic, I can eat a light meal, and feel comfortable until the next one. I have mild side effects like heartburn that are well controlled with omep. I\u2019m down to a weight I haven\u2019t seen since my freshman year of college, and feel amazing. It\u2019s letting me get back into more physical activity, where before I ached and got fatigued far more easily. \n\nI guess the TL;DR is that GLP-1s are not some \u201cshortcut\u201d necessarily, but something to aid those that have a maldeveloped relationship with food. It helps you have a normal reaction physiologically, and that in turn can help you get to a point where you can physically feel better. Do I think there are those who are just using it irresponsibly? Absolutely, I have skinny coworkers who want to take it to \u201close 5 lbs.\u201d but I also think it is an incredibly important medical development for obesity medicine, and overall population health.",

They have significant impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with DM (and I suspect they will honestly have similar in the weight loss cohort of patients).  Trizepatide is now also indicated for moderate sleep apnea as well.\n\nSide effects occur with any medication and it\u2019s a risk benefit analysis anytime someone is started on any drug.  I think the bigger question to ask ourselves when we struggle with the use of this medication for patients is if we are approaching obesity patients with some unconscious bias about people with overweight, obesity, or T2DM.  Are we seeing their disease processes through a lens of laziness, like if they just tried they could change it, when that\u2019s so often (and the data supports this) not the case.",
