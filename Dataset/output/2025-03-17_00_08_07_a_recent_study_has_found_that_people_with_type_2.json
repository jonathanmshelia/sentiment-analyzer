The findings, published in the journal eClinicalMedicine, suggest that this class of medication could have a protective effect on cognitive health for diabetic patients.\n\nOut of the 88,381 participants, those who started treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists had a notably lower incidence of dementia compared to those who used dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. Specifically, the incidence rate of dementia was 6.7 per 1000 person-years for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, 11.8 for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and 13.7 for sulfonylureas.\n\nThe weighted analysis, which adjusted for various baseline characteristics, showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists were associated with a 31% lower risk of dementia compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and a 59% lower risk compared to sulfonylureas. Even when considering adherence to the medication (per-protocol analysis), the protective effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists remained significant.",
