Stores get placed in \"tiers\" based on how busy they are. Higher the tier, the more volume you have, so you get more medications allocated to your store. Our sister store 5 miles away is physically unable to order as much of those meds as I can, as they are two tiers lower.

First people were upset that the rich and elite were taking away from the supply needed by people with real medical need, such as critical diabetics.\n\nThen the social justice warriors jumped in on both sides. One side saying it was a betrayal of body positivity and the other side in some perverse stance that it was cheating and not earned weight loss.\n\nI think that it did answer one debate solidly. That obesity is not a choice. Because once there was a \"magic\" fix everyone that could take it, did so. (well not everyone, but you get my point.) Yes, weight problems are complex and some of it is poor life decisions but much is genetics. It will be interesting to see how society changes (if it does) with changes to the food industry. Will regulation on trans fats, sugar, and corn syrup make a change? Time will tell.",

Calories in/calories out, if you can't do that it's your fault.\n\nWhat more recent science shows us (not just ozempic and related drug studies) is that it's vastly more complicated than that. Genetics and epigenetics are in play. Chronic illness isn't just a result of obesity, but sometimes a cause of obesity. Lifesaving medications can cause obesity. Things we are just starting to understand in the brain cause obesity.\n\nDrugs like ozempic came on the market for diabetes and all of a sudden we saw that it helped people with all kinds of conditions losing weight. Then it got approved for obesity without diabetes, and shit, it worked there too. And now, another unexpected thing - it seems to help alcoholics quit drinking. \n\nWhat society hasn't caught up with yet is that maybe something else has been going on, and maybe there is a treatment for it. Which means maybe there is a cause other than \"that guy won't stop eating, we should shame him.\"\n\nThat said... it's so new and there is so little known about long term side effects. I'm happy about the shift in thinking as far as shame... But not so sure these drugs, as opposed to figuring out why people who get such great results needed them in the first place is the answer.",

No major payers are knowingly paying for these medications for weight loss. Wegovy and Zepbound are only approved for weight loss and the manufacturers package them and distribute them separately than their diabetic counterparts.  Additionally, the majority of people taking semaglutide are using it off label from compounding pharmacies which doesn\u2019t affect the distribution to diabetics at all. Three years ago this wasn\u2019t the case, but at this point, those taking these meds for weight loss are not affecting the supply to diabetics. The reality is that guidelines and prescribing trends have changed and a huge portion of the diabetic population is now taking these medications. Additionally, diabetics tend to take them long term as opposed to 6-12 months like many do for weight loss. This along with manufacturing delays, caused by poor planning and complicated manufacturing processes are why there remains to be a shortage of ozempic.",

Allow me to paint you a picture of someone who is addicted to food\u2019s experience with the drug \u2014 \n\nMany who are morbidly obese, myself included, are addicted to food. My childhood involved an abusive father reconciling with us with ice cream, so food became a comfort in the face of a cruel world. It\u2019s easier if you think of it like any other drug \u2014 I would be binging a whole pizza and already dreaming of my next fix. You try to diet and exercise, but the siren song of the food noise drowns out every rational thought. While many can hide their vices and addictions, we wear ours on our sleeve (or body).\n\nWhen I started Wegovy, I was skeptical on what to expect. Of course I had heard all the noise about people wanting it just as a magical skinny shot, but that\u2019s not what I wanted it for \u2014 of course I wanted to lose weight, but really I hoped for *something* to help navigate the mine field that was my food addiction, and the results for others were hard to ignore.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I began to notice something miraculous \u2014 I felt full without having binged enough food for 3 people for the first time. I felt FULL, and I was eating an appropriate amount of food. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t feel the urge to eat as much, because I wasn\u2019t always starving. Slowly, I realized that since I didn\u2019t feel the urge to eat as much, the food noise - the constant buzz thinking of food, your next meal, next treat - that has plagued my mind since childhood was GONE. It was like someone had flipped a switch in my mind and whispered \u201cthis is what a healthy relationship with food is like\u201d. Suddenly overly processed foods tasted disgusting, the fast food I\u2019d been so addicted to suddenly tasted like the fatty paste it is. It\u2019s been slow steady progress, and it\u2019s not all glamorous. For almost 7 months I had awful nausea, especially the day after my shot, and would randomly need to scuttle off to throw up. Now it\u2019s been almost a year on it, and I only experience the occasional bout of nausea and haven\u2019t thrown up in months. The mental challenges have been the biggest, as food has always been my coping mechanism. How do you cope when you\u2019re coping with losing your coping mechanism?\n\nTo ultimately answer your question \u2014 it\u2019s because there are a lot of people and celebrities taking it for a \u201cmagic fix\u201d, and the general attitude of obese people being weak-willed makes it an easy target for mockery. It doesn\u2019t help at all that these individuals take the medication and supply away from those that\nDO need it. All the patients taking it for legitimate reasons are lumped in with them, as in any similar situation.",

        "body": "My husband is skinny (5\u201911\u201d and 145 pounds) and is prescribed Jardiance for heart failure that is not related to diabetes / obesity. He has to jump through hoops to get his medication covered by insurance because it\u2019s been prescribed for weight loss in the past (it\u2019s not one of the main ones like Ozempic, but it can help a person lose significant weight and is also used for diabetes).  \n\nAt the same time, he doesn\u2019t lose weight while on it. People who use Ozempic and aren\u2019t suffering from the metabolic issues that cause obesity that the drug corrects don\u2019t lose weight while on it. It actually seems to be a cure for obesity for many people because it treats the cause of obesity for those people. \n\nI don\u2019t consider that cheating. A lot of people do, and they\u2019re upset that \u201clazy\u201d people don\u2019t have to \u201cput in the work.\u201d Others are upset because it drives up the price of the drugs for people who need it (people in heart failure and diabetics) and causes shortages. \n\nI don\u2019t think we should be blaming individuals for this, however. We should be blaming pharmaceutical companies and we should be blaming our governments, because this is potentially the cure for the obesity epidemic and all of the diseases that come with it (and all of the money spent on those diseases). \n\nRemember how our government pushed out Covid shots and made them cheap or free for everyone? I\u2019m not saying that, exactly, should happen, but I\u2019m saying that they could and *should* do more. \n\nInstead, they\u2019re happy to let those companies rake in the profits and limit supplies (and getting into that is getting into politics, so I\u2019ll leave it there).",

Probably similar to the crowd who tell you that you don\u2019t have depression, you just need to suck it up, etc. \n\nThe latter are much more annoying. I\u2019ve gotten so many speeches about how I just need to diet and exercise and I\u2019ll lose weight, ignoring that I have had these problems for 20 years, of which I was dieting and exercising. I\u2019ve now learned to explain it to them that I\u2019m not losing weight because of the easy drug but because I experience hunger the way they do now. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten lectures about clean eating (I went for years eating no sugar or processed foods) and that junk food is bad, but I\u2019ve literally experienced disordered hunger signals since I was 5. My mom worked super hard to make me eat right and exercise and none of it worked. She was judged and lectured for her fat kid (even with a second kid that had none of these problems). \n\nThe medication makes my brain not obsess and believe I\u2019m starving to death at all times. And people don\u2019t get that. They just think I wanted an easy way out.",
