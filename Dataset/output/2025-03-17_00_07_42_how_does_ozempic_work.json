        "body": "Ohhhh this is my wheelhouse!\n\nGLP-1 medications do a LOT, but alter your metabolism actually isn't one of the things it does! Here are a few ways it works (there are actually a lot):\n\nGLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that gets released by the intestine usually about 15 minutes after starting a meal to signal the stomach and brain 'cool, that's enough.'\n\nIn the stomach, it actually slows your stomachs ability to process the food and send it to your small intestine. You feel full, faster because your stomach empties itself much slower. This is one of the reasons some people get really bad nausea when they first start these medications-because they eat super quickly. The slower you eat each meal, the less likely you are to experience nausea due to the actual volume of food. If you eat super fast, your stomach goes from 'comfortable' to 'HOLY CRAP' (think: super stretched) very quickly.\n\nIn the brain, that signal is essentially mimicking \"I've eaten enough\" which is viewed as limiting cravings, eliminating food noise, etc. Unfortunately, some people's brains are VERY sensitive to this signal, which can cause nausea without your stomach being stretched. Really sucks for this subset of the population, but it generally improves with time.\n\nInstead of GLP-1 medications changing your metabolism (which is more of an old wives tale than anything), it actually mimics your bodys natural response to being appropriately satiated, causing you to have fewer cravings, fewer instances of 'eating because you're bored' and helps you eat quite a bit less.\n\nIt does plenty of other things for diabetes management not associated with eating less as well as for heart health, but that's the basis of why people on these medications eat less.\n\nThere are a lot more things GLP-1 does and I made a little graphic that I'll add to this response-it's a bit over-simplified but can give you a better understanding of everything it can do-I'll add it to this post.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rw6o9kr3u85e1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b119e00363e695ed94e3febf8ccf489ce1234f4",

        "body": "There are LOADS of layers to this! May be a long response-\n\nThe 'eat less' paradigm is indeed accurate, but it's very much oversimplified. A more correct statement it to 'eat fewer calories.' One of my favorite examples is eating 1 pound of strawberries is 150 calories. Eating one serving of peanut butter is 200 calories. So while 1 pound of strawberries is WAY more food than 1 serving of peanut butter, the bucket of strawberries has fewer calories. It's the concept of calorie density-fewer calories per volume of food. One of the reasons I want people to eat mainly whole/minimally processed foods is that it's hard to eat way too many calories with those foods and its VERY easy to over-eat processed foods high in sugar, salt and fat because, well, they're delicious.\n\nAs we learn more and more about the drivers of obesity and overeating, there are tons of factors impacting our eating habits. While I don't exactly agree with 'being under attack' from food companies, I do see and agree with the general point-every TV commercial is either fast food or candy because, well, they're businesses and it's really hard to develop a marketing campaign for salmon, broccoli and sweet potatoes.\n\nThat brings me to my next point where I find much of the true issue-education.\n\nLong gone are the days where we'd learn about nutrition in schools. I saw a super interesting (to me, a nerd) documentary on school lunches in Japan. Every lunch comes with a nutrition lecture from a dietician to teach the kids about proper nutrition, and everything in the school is made fresh in house, that day. Those kids get a level of education that most of us will never get, and that sets them up for success for their entire lives.\n\nWith regards to GLP1 medications, i have never and will never suggest that everyone overweight needs them. I lost 100 pounds about 12 years ago and have managed to keep it off even though i do still struggle with food noise and binge eating, although less so now than when i was 300 pounds. I know very well that sustained weight loss is possible without medication.\n\nThat being said, i view these medications as having 2 potential uses:\n\n1. Some people will need a boost. These medications can lower the barrier of entry to a healthy lifestyle. As people use these medications to lose weight, my hope is that they use that time to re-wire their brains and habits to develop a lifestyle that leads to lifelong health. After time, some people may want to try and wean off the medication (who wants to be on medication? I'm a type 1 diabetic and need insulin to survive, but i still dont like needing/taking medication).\n\n2. More commonly, in many cases, obesity is a chronic illness, not simply a representation of nutritional choices. For whatever reason, perhaps some people don't have the brain signals to stop eating when they've eaten enough (I've got that one, lol), some people may have heightened dopamine responses to ultraprocessed foods (this is *not* the same as addiction, but it can look similar) and many others. I view this kind of like i view blood pressure. If someone comes to clinic with high blood pressure, they may get a medication and get their blood pressure under control. Once that happens, we don't simply stop the medication because then the blood pressure will go back to elevated.\n\nI know that was a lot, but i hope it helps clarify some things!",
