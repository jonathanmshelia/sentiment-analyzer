Normal A1c now down from 9.3++ to 4.4\n\nSounds like you are \u2018skinny fat\u2019 body type so under muscled is your issue.\n\nI\u2019m also restarting Low dose ozempic but it\u2019s mainly to reduce inflammation &amp; satiety.\n\nWeight loss is mainly due to diet.\n\nWhen bodybuilders want to gain muscle they stay high protein, but increase their carbs &amp; fat intake while doing regular resistance exercise.\n\nI put your rough stats into the bodybuilding TDEE calculator that I use. Check it out:\n\nhttps://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&amp;g=male&amp;age=36&amp;lbs=130&amp;in=64&amp;act=1.2&amp;bf=10&amp;f=2\n\nNOTE:  these are your stats \u2018as if\u2019 you were at ideal bodyweight of 130lbs\n\nYour avg reference (leanest) weight for your height &amp; sex is ~ 130 lbs\n\nSo for you, might try a bulking routine, resistance training 3-4x/week &amp; something like these macros:\n\nAbout 1700 kcal/day\n\nPROTEIN: 130g minimum\n\nCARBS: Total 40g/NET 25g maximum \n\n\nFATS: 120g \nHealthy whole food fat only: EVOO, UNREFINED COCONUT OIL, AVOCADO, GRASS FED BUTTER/GHEE, BEEF TALLOW\n(No seed oils or processed)\n\n\nThe higher protein &amp; higher fat from whole foods can often help also increase testosterone which is crucial to building increased lean muscle.\n\nAlso if nec, try a wuality whey protein ISOLATE supplement to meet your protein goal.  I use ISOPURE, TRANSPARENT LABS, or NOW.  The isolate version is best for muscle building, imho.\n\nGeyba kitchen food scale (they are cheap) &amp; try a free macro tracking app like my fitness pal or carbmanager.com.  Tracking macros will really help get to your goal faster. \n\nSo, (not medical advice) but just some thoughts based upon my training experience. Hope it\u2019s helpful!!\n\n\ud83d\udd96",

Weight loss is just a happy side effect of ozempic for a lot of people, as it can adjust appetite signals.\n\nOzempic's primary mechanism is to stimulate insulin production when blood sugars increase. It might be very effective for you if your problem is your pancreas not producing much insulin when food is eaten. It also seems to improve how receptive your cells are to using insulin and absorbing glucose.\n\nI would say give Ozempic a go for a few months, see what it does for you. If you find your appetite too suppressed, then stop taking it. It may even have the opposite effect on you, being slightly underweight, by letting your body absorb more of the glucose you do eat, and help you gain a healthy weight.\n\nThere are other medications for T2 of Ozempic fail and metformin isn't enough.",
