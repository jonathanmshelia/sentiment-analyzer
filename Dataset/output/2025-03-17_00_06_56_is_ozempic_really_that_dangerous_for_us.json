While it\u2019s not very common, it can happen when taking medications like Ozempic or other GLP-1 receptor agonists.\n\nTo stay on top of this, I recommend getting some ketone test strips to monitor your ketone levels. Small amounts of ketones are usually okay from time to time, but if you see large amounts, it\u2019s important to contact your doctor\u2014or even go to the ER.\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulty controlling your blood sugar, Ozempic or a similar medication might still be a good option for you. Just be mindful of the potential risks associated with reduced insulin levels. Most likely, your doctor will start you on a low dose, so your insulin needs might only decrease slightly.\n\nThe key is to keep an eye on your ketones while monitoring your overall health. Since you\u2019ve already consulted your doctor about this, I\u2019ll leave it at that\u2014but it\u2019s always good to stay proactive about potential side effects.",

My A1Cs were not too terrible before (tended to be high 6's to low 7's) and my last one was 6.9 so still in that range. Important things I've learned about managing on this medication: \n\n-Don't eat too close to bedtime as the food is more likely to get stuck in your gut overnight leading to morning nausea and even vomiting.\n\n-Fiber supplements can also help ensure the food keeps moving and doesn't get stuck! \n\n-Losing weight on it is normal though not guaranteed. \n\n-You may want to be more vigilant against going low the first few months. To that end, invest in juices if you haven't already - these meds slow your digestion too much to rely on solid food to raise your bloodsugar but liquids will still be absorbed quickly.\n\nGood luck!",
