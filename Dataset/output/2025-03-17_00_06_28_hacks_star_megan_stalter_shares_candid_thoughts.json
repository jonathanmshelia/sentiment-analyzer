I don\u2019t have the shit problem, but constipation due to low carb diet I\u2019m trying to stick to. 3 months in at .5 mg and it\u2019s 15 lbs down. Not amazing but the whole not eating all day is easy. You don\u2019t feel hungry, so you need to force some food down or you will get low blood sugar eventually.",

It is curbing their dopamine seeking behaviors which is reducing a host of destructive behaviors (shopping, junk food binging, do scrolling etc).\n\nIt\u2019s quite remarkable. \n\nAnecdotally: A family member has struggled with food addiction for 30+ years and started Zepbound 3 months ago and has turned their life around while losing 3-6 pounds per week. They report some mild intestinal discomfort the first 24 hours after the injection, less frequent bowel movements, but otherwise no significant side effects to report\n\n&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide (Ozempic), have been observed to influence dopamine-related behaviors, particularly those associated with reward and addiction. Recent studies indicate that these medications may reduce cravings for substances like alcohol and nicotine by modulating the brain\u2019s reward pathways. For instance, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that individuals with alcohol use disorder who received semaglutide consumed 30% less alcohol and reported diminished cravings compared to those given a placebo.\n\n&gt; The mechanism behind this effect involves GLP-1 RAs\u2019 interaction with the central nervous system, where they can impact dopamine release in areas such as the nucleus accumbens, a region integral to processing reward. By attenuating excessive dopamine activity, GLP-1 RAs may reduce the reinforcing effects of addictive substances, thereby decreasing the motivation to engage in such behaviors.   \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11202225/",
