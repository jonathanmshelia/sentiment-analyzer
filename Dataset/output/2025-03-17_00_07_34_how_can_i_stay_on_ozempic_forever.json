And I keep taking 0.75mg every week.   \nIt was not on my plans to stay forever, but my doctor suggested it from day one. And I ended up liking the idea a lot.  \n\\- I eat normally and have no side effects from the medication. Just eat less and crave less.   \n\\- I still feel hungry, but not that angry-hungry, desperate for food.   \n\\- I have little constipation, but I offset it with extra fibre. Honestly, this was a bonus. Before, I was quite loose, going to the toilet several times a day. Now, I go once a day or two. Perfect.  \n\\- I am finally a normal person regarding my relationship with food.   \nI keep visiting the doctor every 6 months to evaluate (and get a new prescription). I live in Ireland, and each pen is affordable (\u20ac120). So yeah, I am pretty much planning to stay on it forever! Ozempic or any other that pops up in the future.",

Young people\u2019s bodies are still developing and not as set in stone as older people.\n\n3) If you can use this as a tool to lose the excess weight in conjunction with healthy eating and lifestyle, for all we know you might not need it going forward. If you don\u2019t need to take this medication forever, that should be a good thing, and it is what I hope for myself even though I am one of the older more ill people and it may not be so.\n\n4) A couple studies showed that when slowly titrated off glp-1 medication half of people didn\u2019t regain, and those who did had varying levels of regain (only a small percent gained it all back, some had insignificant regain). Their advice was to use minimum effective dosing and titrate on and off as need, so try going off and if regain starts - can always take the medication again. \n\n4) focus on this step of the journey, don\u2019t worry about the next one. There is more research, evidence and medication coming through the pipeline that will give us (and your doctor) more information to help make future decisions.",

You need to figure this out on your own eventually.\n\nAnd I have yet to see ANY studies posted saying otherwise. It\u2019s simply less calories and obese people will go through hoops and loops to make it seem like it\u2019s not. \n\nOne single study. That\u2019s it.",

Eventually you WILL have to learn how to eat properly on your own because Ozempic doesn\u2019t work forever. \n\nLoops and hoops but you can\u2019t get away from biology.
