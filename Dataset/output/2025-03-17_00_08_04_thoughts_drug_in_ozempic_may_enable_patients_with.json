        "body": "Hi!  I was not part of this study, but as a T1 diagnosed ~3 years ago, I was prescribed Ozempic to prolong my honeymoon and am happy to share my journey.\n\nWhen first diagnosed, I was able to take a fairly small amount of basal insulin per day (6-8 units of Tresiba), with no fast acting insulin.  I also largely removed sugar from my diet, and limited carbs to roughly 30-45g per meal, and used a cgm to generally plan my food around my sugar.\n\nThis worked quite well for nearly a year, though with steadily increasing basal doses.  Eventually things got to a point where my post prandial spikes were taking too long to come down (over an hour above 180 on a lowish carb meal) and I asked my provider about MDI or a pump.  I was on roughly 18 units of Tresiba at this point, and also had a fast acting for \"just in case\" times or if I wanted to indulge in some more substantial carbs.\n\nAt this time, she recommended trying a small dose of Ozempic to see if we could extend my honeymoon.  I very gradually moved up to .25 mg, and had a significant response to the medication.  I was able to move back down to 6-8 units of Tresiba in normal circumstances, and in times when I was exercising significantly (ie, a beach vacation with lots of walking and swimming) I went off insulin entirely since I was getting so many lows.  I had normal Ozempic side effects (digestive issues) but they were pretty mild.\n\nI continued forward at .25 of Ozempic and slowly increasing doses of basal insulin for another ~3 months or so.  Then we again began to see post prandial spikes beyond what my Endo and I were comfortable with, so I moved to .5 mg of Ozempic.  Similar results to last time, this time with another 6-9 months passing before needing to up my Ozempic dose.\n\nFinally, we moved to a full 1 mg of Ozempic.  In terms of control, it was fantastic.  My sugar was great, and I was again on a fairly small basal dose of insulin.  However at this point even after 2-3 months of trying to acclimate my body the side effects were just too much for me.  I spent a good deal of time being nauseous, avoiding eating much food, and generally feeling miserable.\n\nAt this point we moved back my Ozempic dose to .5 mg, and upped my basal to 16 units of Tresiba.  This sort of worked but post prandial spikes were still getting a little high for comfort, even after turning up the basal to 22 units.  I was also having a fairly high basal rate, with blood sugars below 120 feeling uncomfortable for me.\n\nAt this point I began doing a very mild form of MDI when I knew a challenging food was coming up.  I was very hesitant, as the few times I used fast acting insulin with Ozempic, even in extremely low doses, it drove me to some fairly scary lows.  However in very small doses this worked, giving me 85%+ time in target on my cgm and generally getting basal and post prandial blood sugar into a more comfortable range.\n\nThis brings us to my current state.  After discussing with my Endo, she was comfortable with me to stick with the previous regimen, but I decided to move towards a pump.  If I'm already doing multiple doses of insulin a day I don't view the side effects of Ozempic as worth it.  I'm also highly interested in moving to an open source looping solution (Android APS), which she was aware of and comfortable with me exploring based on a history of good control and my background in tech.\n\nI am currently in week 3 post Ozempic, full MDI trying to nail down what my constants for an insulin pump would be, and will be switching to an Omnipod Dash paired with a Dexcom via Android APS in the near future.\n\nOverall, I'd certainly recommend talking to your Endo about Ozempic or other semaglutide medication if you are recently diagnosed and still have some pancreas functionality.  I can't speak to any long term benefits, but it helped me extend my honeymoon period, which offered significant mental health benefits as I eased into the life of a T1D a little more gradually.  I also believe the ability to have more time to learn how certain foods and activities affect my blood sugar, and just the general vocabulary and working knowledge of being a diabetic likely means I've had better control in these first few years than I would've otherwise.\n\nPlease let me know any questions, happy to help any other folks I can.",

I started seeing high insulin resistance and I had and endo who decided to prescribe it to see if it would help and it did. A few years ago I was again struggling with high insulin resistance. I am on a pump and was using roughly 150 units of insulin a day! My endo switched me to Humalog U200 and also put me on ozempic. That was a huge change for me. I saw a dramatic improvement in my sugar levels and it almost completely eliminated the dramatic spikes I'd see after eating a meal. Unfortunately my previous Insurance Company stopped covering ozempic and I spent a few months struggling again with dramatic spikes and drops. After my divorce this past January I switched from my ex's Insurance to my company's and they are covering my prescription for wegovy. My endo specifically prescribed it to help me lose weight. Which ultimately will help with my insulin resistance etc.\n\nLong story short, I've had great success using ozempic and Wegovy to control my blood sugar levels and I'm starting to see some weight loss! Fyi my A1C on these meds has been consistently under 5.6 since I started them. Before was 6-7.5.",

        "body": "I was recognized as having detectable c-peptide and random insulin production causing excessive scary lows when I was first diagnosed with t1 a few years after failing an OGTT. I was started on insulin at 22, right away, but then saw a research endocrinologist who explained that there was data on this drug Victoza in t1 like me and he put me on it once I got my A1c below 7.5 on my own. I was able to cut insulin in half, which was huge because I was extremely resistant when my pancreas wasn\u2019t making little amounts of insulin, and scared to death of lows living alone in a big city. I was skinny, but I had never heard of the drug and had no idea about weight loss. I didn\u2019t lose weight, either. \n\nVictoza had me honeymooning for a few more years until insurance yanked coverage, and when I was off it, I immediately went back to being incredibly \u201cbrittle\u201d and constantly battling unpredictable insulin needs. I also developed an eye bleed and seizures (not bg related\u2014maybe microvascular badness in the brain too?) while off of it.\nI fought like hell with insurance to get back on. My eye is normal. My seizures are hopefully resolved, and I will learn more in the EMU soon, but there are already early signals of possible benefits of GLP-1 drugs in epilepsy if I am not mistaken. \n\nI\u2019m now on 0.5 of Ozempic. My BMI is 18 or 18.5, whatever is the low end of normal but not underweight. It takes weeks to reach steady state, and it is night and day when it is in my system or not. I will not fully give up this drug. \n\nThe knowledge translation gap is real. It seems like on some level, we\u2019ve known these drugs are the next big thing for years. I do think people need to be careful and pay attention to their bodies though. These shouldn\u2019t be taken if you\u2019re sick with a stomach thing, or underweight, or they\u2019re causing you to have side effects like nausea and malaise that cause you not to eat or take you put of your normal activities. Like anything, they can\u2019t do everything. But I find it an indispensable tool in my care. \n\nThe conversation around all if the health benefits other than weight loss has been limited by the public conversation about these drugs being primarily centered on the weight loss doses and the effects of those. I\u2019m never going to be on a weight loss dose of Ozempic. I don\u2019t want to be, because I don\u2019t need to be. But I sure as hell want stable blood sugars, predictable insulin needs, and to get the protective benefits for my eyes, heart, brain, et cetera. My quality of life being able to manage my diabetes is night and day. \n\nTLDR - \n1. Ozempic great at weight appropriate dose for T1 and likely T3c too I would imagine(?), and will be ripped from my cold dead hands. \n\n2. People having problems on them are likely on too high a dose (you can titrate more slowly than the doses on the box with your endo! if you have nasty side effects or feel like shit, lay off!) or can\u2019t tolerate them. \n\n3. Let\u2019s start talking about all of the benefits that are not weight loss. And let\u2019s advocate for access and coverage.",

Risk is defined by having two or more autoantibodies and abnormal blood sugar (Stage 2), plus at least one high-risk marker (based on test results).
