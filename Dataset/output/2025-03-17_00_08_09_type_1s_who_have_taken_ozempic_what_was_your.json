For people who are seeking weight loss, this makes them feel full and also sends a signal to the brain that the stomach is full, so they don\u2019t feel hungry. \n\nFor a T1 approaching or experiencing low blood sugar, this food that\u2019s parked in the stomach can also slow the absorption of glucose tablets or other treatment so the way you would normally treat a low may not be sufficient.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that T1s should not take these meds, lots of people seem to be having success with them.

I went on it for weight loss and to curb hunger responses. \nThe amazing quiet I had in my brain the first day after taking it was incredible. I had no idea just how much noise was being created by the constant hunger and amylin deficiency. \nI've been able to drop from about 60 units a day to 30-40 pretty consistently. I can't say my overall levels have changed much or that I experience less highs or lows. \nI've also dropped about 16lbs, so not massive, but I also don't take a big dose.\n\nWhat I would warn about is I didn't know before starting it that it changes your sensitivity to insulin, so lesson learned. I also had to make changes around my sugar management and exercise and planning that low corrections take longer because your stomach empties slower so any sugar you ingest takes longer to hit. It's not a make or break issue but it's definitely something to be aware of. \nAlso you will need to change the timing of when you take your insulin as others have mentioned. I used to bolus at the beginning of a meal but if I don't that now, I will go low.\nTLDR: good experience, 10/10 recommend",

I had to go off for 4 months while fighting insurance and my health plummeted. It was pure hell. I went to the gym every day to try to avoid weight gain, I was gaining 3 lbs per week. I do not ever recommend stopping if you decide to start. Do not ever jump to too strong of a dose,  especially if it's out of your system for more than 10 days.  I currently take 1.7 Wegovy.   In the beginning of my Ozempic use,  I lost 30 lbs in 3 months.  The meds are no joke.  In one day,  I went from needing 70u of insulin to 15u. It is a switch for insulin resistance.

My numbers are ok (last A1c was 7.5) and I have some stubborn post-baby weight to lose. I don't over eat, not really. I track my calories off and on and will maybe average 100-200 calories over 1200/day. In the past the only thing that has helped me with weight loss has been exercising at least an hour every day. \n\nMy guess is that since the medication slows down digestion in the stomach as part of the weight loss effect, then maybe I wasn't taking enough insulin to cover the span of time my food was digesting? No idea! But yeah, OP, your experience with this med may vary. Wouldn't hurt to reach out to an Endo team that is more open to letting patients try medications off label (since these drugs aren't approved for use by T1s yet). Good luck!",
