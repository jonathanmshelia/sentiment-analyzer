        "body": "I do research in a lab which is looking into semaglutide, which is the generic for Ozempic. This is a bit of a long post, but I would like to give some background on the mechanisms and stuff underlying the drug.\n\nIt originally started off as a diabetes medication and it was proven to be effective. Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance where your insulin doesn\u2019t work as well as it should.\n\nInsulin is released in response to high blood sugar after eating. It causes you to store fat (lipogenesis) create glycogen (glycogenesis) produce some ATP to be used immediately for energy (glycolysis) and it also inhibits the opposite of those processes. That way your body stops breaking down fat for energy (lipolysis) stops producing new sugar from other intermediates (gluconeogenesis) and stops breaking down glycogen stores (glycogenolysis). Those specific pathways don\u2019t matter too much, but basically just know that insulin stores energy from blood sugar after you eat. \n\nSemaglutide is a GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide 1. It is called glucagon like peptide because it has the same precursor mRNA as glucagon before being spliced, but it actually does the opposite of glucagon but that isn\u2019t important) receptor agonist meaning it activates a membrane receptor protein called GLP-1. When GLP is activated, it has a similar effect to insulin. It activates and inhibits the metabolic pathways I mentioned above and it stores blood sugar as energy. Having this protein activated by semaglutide helps reduce blood sugar and other negative effects of insulin resistance. \n\nThe thing about the human body though is that it\u2019s not as simple as having a few pathways which are inhibited and activated. These GLP-1 receptor agonists also do stuff to your brain (I think in the nucleus accumbens but I might be wrong) which will reduce addictive cravings and make you feel full. Studies show it also helps reduce addictive cravings with alcoholism as well. Your body won\u2019t get the same dopamine rush from eating and you\u2019ll stop craving food as much. This is good because diabetes and obesity are often related to each other, and this drug will help tackle both of the problems.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that it is a miracle drug though. There are a lot of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. I also read somewhere that it is very bad for your thyroid over time. Not to mention, it is a relatively new drug and there aren\u2019t many long term chronic studies with it yet so who knows what it\u2019ll do after decades of use. You need to work with the your primary care doctor or endocrinologist to see if the positive effects of losing weight will outweigh the negative effects of the medication. \n\nIt has been stirring up a crazy lately because a lot of celebrities have been taking ozempic or wegovy and this is making it very popular. They are also advertising the drug hard on TV and stuff. Overall, I feel like this is a great drug and could have a lot of positive effects, but ofc with every medication there are risks and side effects involved.\n\nedit: please do not ask me for medical advice I\u2019m not a doctor lol. I just do research on the drug which involves injecting and gavaging it into mice and look at mechanisms behind it.",

It makes me feel like shit to say but I even got gastric bypass surgery, lost a ton of weight and put it back on within 2 years after COVID hit and depression rammed me like a dump truck, resorting to eating to cope.\n\nSince I started on Ozempic, the amount of food I'm eating daily has more than halved. I eat a big breakfast and it can keep me going till dinnertime with maybe a small snack in between, and a small snack late at night. Before I'd eat 3 meals a day and several snacks in between meals.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is that it feels like I'm constantly more or less full, and my doctor said I need to make sure I remind myself to eat so I don't go to the extremes, which I thought would be easy but it really isn't. I have to make sure I remind myself to eat enough to keep me going, and honestly while I'm getting used to the new normal I feel quite a bit weaker. I'm a really big guy so eating this little takes getting used to, but honestly, I don't mind.\n\nI  started with a quarter dose for 4 weeks, then I get half-dose for another 4 weeks, then eventually a full dose ongoing until I stop. The side effects have been minimal for me luckily with only a bit of nausea and a bit of diarrhoea but it's not too bad.\n\nHonestly, I feel like the people most outspoken against it are the kinds of people that believe that if you want to lose weight you should suffer and deal with doing it the \"traditional\" way. I say piss off, I have so much pain in my life that if there's something that can help ease such an important thing, then I'm taking it.",

In a diabetic person this results in lower weight, superior glucose control and better overall A1C values.\n\nIf you are not diabetic, it still results in lower appetite, meaning weight loss- almost like a bypass with no surgery. \n\nPeople are angry at this because (IMHO) they want fat people to suffer for their perceived gluttony instead of just minding their business. For someone like me, it means my diabetes is under control and I\u2019ve lost 1/3 of my body weight. I can now exercise as I want and maintain good health instead of feeling absolutely awful all the time. My entire diet has changed and I worked with a dietician for 9 months and while I lost my weight.",

I was pretty wary of the side effects, but considering it as I had dealt with this weight for a decade and I know being obese also has its own issues. I deal with binge eating and restriction which was always a big issue for me which started after gaining all the weight from meds. I have ADHD and ended up getting prescribed Vyvanse by my psychiatrist as she said not only will it help with the ADHD, but that it's also FDA approved for binge eating. On the days I take it I'm able to easily eat within a normal deficit, just have to track calories so I don't overly restrict or overeat something that's super high calorie, but it's so much easier now. (If I don't take the med tho I still way overeat, but it's a day by day med so I usually take it and on days I do something special I just don't). In one month I've lost ten pounds, so a pretty healthy weight loss and the med also helps with the ADHD too. Nothing against ozempic, but I would rather try to find the best possible options I can and ozempic doesn't solve the underlying issue for me, which is overeating and bingeing due to ADHD, while vyvanse does.",
