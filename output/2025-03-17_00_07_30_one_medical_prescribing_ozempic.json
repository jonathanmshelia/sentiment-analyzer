My OBGYN prescribed it for me. I have friends who have health insurance that covers the weight loss versions though and insurance coverage was based on BMI. The prescribing guidelines for Zepbound are a BMI of 30 or over, or a BMI of 27 and weight related health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, etc. And again these drugs are not supposed to go to people who don't need them but if you can find an unethical doctor to prescribe it and are willing to pay the cost without insurance coverage then yeah you can get them.",
