My BG numbers are UNBELIEVABLE.  In fact, so crazy-good that the Pharmacist (my doc had me see a pharmacist for prescribing and following me for better T2D control) has only increased my dose to .5ml.  She does not plan to increase it unless my fasting increases to over 130.  Currently, my fasting is around 95-110.  My overall average BG for the past 42 days is 110, which equates to a 5.5 A1C!

It has been a great appetite suppressant to the point of no interest in food, really, unless my blood sugar drops below 90 and then I'm hungry.  But I am eating small portions and feel SO full after--that's the most discomfort I feel is the unbelievable feeling of fullness!  Due to my fear of the side effects, I did a lot of reading about it--only about 20% experience the nausea.  I felt that 80% of NO nausea are pretty good odds so that encouraged me to jump in.  My 4th injection, I moved up to .5 ml and so far, so good.  I've been able to titrate down my insulin to half of what I was taking before OZ and looking forward to continuing to reduce it--hate those daily shots!  Best of luck to you!  Come back here and let me know how you do.",

My diabetes was not \"poorly managed\" as you say, but we just couldn't get my fasting number below 120 no matter what we tried.  Once a long acting insulin was added, my number was FINALLY at goal.  I've been advised to titrate off the insulin as I take Ozempic and maybe, just maybe, I will eventually be able to get off the Metformin as well.  IMHO, though, I've always had an insulin resistance, even when I was not overweight, which is what the Metformin helps with, so I'm not so hopeful that Ozempic will help with that.  We'll see!",

        "body": "Sorry, bad choice of words. By \"poorly managed\" I did not mean you were eating sugar or doing things diabetics shouldn't, just that the meds you are taking are not adequate to control your BGL at a safe level without additional insulin. No slight to you was intended. Sometimes our bodies just dont like us. My mother in law is the same way. Does all the right things but could not get the sugar below a 12 (216). She has a terrible doctor and won't listen to me. She just recently got ozempic and has managed to get her numbers under control.\n\nOverall, Ozempic will do the same thing that Metformin will do for your insulin resistance (release insulin in response to food intake) but ozempic will do it better. \n\nMetformin works by telling your pancreas to always be producing more insulin. Ozempic will only tell the pancreas to produce it when you need it. Whether it will cause your pancreas to produce enough to get off insulin? We won't know for a while. Whether you can get off metformin? We'll metformin does have a lot of endothelial health benefits as well so if you don't go off of it, it isn't a bad thing. \n\nSide note: we don't often get tested for insulin resistance (it's not an easy test to do) and we also don't often get tested for insulin levels specifically. Most everything is based off of blood sugar levels. So unless you've done those tests, it is entirely possible you don't produce enough insulin in the first place. Which could be why you need the long lasting insulin to maintain your BGL. It could all be insulin resistance. Or it could be insulin resistance with exhausted beta islet cells.",
