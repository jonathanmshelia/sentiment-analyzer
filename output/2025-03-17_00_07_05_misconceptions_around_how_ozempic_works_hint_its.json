Human studies have shown weight loss benefits with time-restricted eating (e.g.,\u00a0[NEJM JW Gen Med Oct 1 2022](https://www.jwatch.org/na55229)\u00a0and\u00a0*JAMA Intern Med*\u00a02022 182:953) but have not consistently controlled for total calorie intake.\n\nInvestigators addressed this issue with a randomized, controlled trial in which 41 adults (mean age, 59) with obesity (mean weight, 99 kg) and prediabetes or diet-controlled diabetes received isocaloric diets with equivalent micro- and macronutrient composition; calorie amounts were based on metabolic needs and activity levels. Food was prepared in a study kitchen and consumed onsite or taken home. The intervention group was instructed to eat between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and to consume 80% of calories by 1 p.m. The control group was instructed to eat between 8 a.m. and midnight, with 55% of calories after 5 p.m.\n\nWeight loss in the two groups was similar at 12 weeks (about 2.4 kg). Various glycemic measures also did not differ between groups.\"",

OP says it's fun to watch, however, I think it's a slippery slope. In my experience, most people do not know what a significant blood sugar spike is nor understand postprandial responses in general. So it starts to create disordered eating that can result in extreme cutting, or fear of blood sugar rising at all.\n\nI work in food science to an extent, and the level of misinformation about blood sugar scares me. It's currently being pushed as such an extreme thing, some people can spike about 10 points when they wake up from like a fasted 70 to an 80 and genuinely believe they have \"hurt themselves.\" To make matters worse, the monitor is generally 10-20 points off at any time which is NBD for diabetics (as often if their sugars are 200+, being slightly off is still valuable AF to know) and it can depend on where you wear it so if you sleep on it you'll get a higher reading.\n\nI believe in a decade or two, we will see a new ED from this type of monitoring, much like how people can get too into macros and/or calories and restrict. I would strongly suggest just eating less sugar, and trying to consume balanced meals that have good fats and protein and fiber.",

The brown adipose tissue, lipolysis and thermogenesis papers all speak to GLP-1 drugs actually increasing the 'CO' part of the equation either directly or indirectly, while the related papers on ob/ob mice demonstrate that the same animal at the same starting weight can eat the same number of calories as a related animal in a controlled setting and still become obese while the other animal remains lean (because the CO part of the equation is modulated by some other factor).

        "body": "Unfortunately, you won't be able to provide a study that supports that particular assertion. At bottom, Calories In vs Calories Out is the controlling principle of weight loss. It is not negotiable or arguable. It derives from the laws of thermodynamics. So unless someone can literally break the laws of physics, they will have to contend with CICO.\n\nOf course, the nuance is the \"in\" and \"out\" pieces. Not every calorie you eat is absorbed into your body. Although the body is pretty efficient at absorbing energy from food, people absorb (i.e., take in) different amount of calories depending on genetics, environmental factors, health factors, time of day, blood sugar levels (as you mentioned), etc. for the same food ingested. Moreover, people burn (i.e., take out) different amounts of calories for the same activities based on height, weight, genetics, metabolism, etc. All of this is uncontroversial.\n\n**BUT** that does not mean that CICO is useless. Quite the opposite, in fact: counting calories from your food will literally provide the *upper* limit of your intake because calorie information is based on an assumption of 100% absorption (i.e., how much energy is in the food, not how much you *absorb*). So, if you \"ate\" 2000 calories, that is the **most** you could have absorbed. It goes without saying that you cannot absorb more than 100% of the energy available in food (again, thermodynamics).\n\nTo sum up, if you calculate your total calorie expenditure within a reasonable degree of accuracy, track your calories, and *consistently* eat less calories than your daily expenditure, you **will** lose weight. If you do not, then it is because you either (1) are not tracking your calories \"eaten\" (not absorbed) properly or (2) your estimate of calorie expenditure is significantly off and should be reduced. It's as simple as that. No one can break the laws of physics.\n\nAccordingly, the speed of weight loss is simply determined by the deficit between calories burned vs calories absorbed. If people lose weight faster on ozempic, it is because they eat/absorb less calories than people not on ozempic. The slower digestion and blood sugar mediation may effect that through appetite suppression, but they do not, directly, cause weight loss. Anything else that suppresses appetite (or simply not eating through willpower) will produce the same weight loss, *all else being equal* (this is the big caveat, since people on Ozempic are obviously more likely to stick to a diet plan more easily than someone attempting to lose weight through willpower alone).",

This is extremely different from the widely held belief in most media right now that is about Ozempic. What you commonly read is that they were seeking a diabetes drug and oh my god, in this most recent study they stumbled upon this idea that it's amazing for weight loss. You're saying, no, from the very beginning, we thought that this could do both.\n\nLotte: Yeah, it is a common misunderstanding. I think that maybe a little bit comes also for the lizard story. It's just not true. We were the only company for 20 years that pursued obesity. The weight loss that was seen with Exenatide and also with some of the other early agents were never going to be enough to obtain an approval for the treatment of obesity.\n\nSomehow these fatty acid acetylated compounds actually do a little bit better on weight loss. We saw that. I guess we were also a little bit lucky. There's some luck to everything that we didn't know, of course, going in with this fatty acid acetylation technology that would work or actually work even a little bit better for obesity than some of the other methods. **But we did have a strategic intent to go after obesity early on.**\n\nWe've been alone in that for the longest time in keeping up with the medical community experts out there. We've just been going at it for 20 years. It's only within maybe a little bit more than five years that we see other companies going in and now everyone's in there. Back then it was only us. There was a lot of interest in obesity also in pharma, but they all wanted to make small molecules that would deeply penetrate the brain.\n\nThere were some made, but then there were side effects. There was also a hormone, I don't know if you stumbled upon a hormone called leptin that is produced by the fat tissue, that was another idea that is approved today for lipodystrophy.\"",

I have Type 2 diabetes, combined with significant obesity (BMI is close to 40). I have found that Ozempic has really brought my blood sugar under control, and I have also lost almost 10 kg - without being aware of the weight loss until I weighed myself a week ago.\n\nIn Australia, there has been a shortage of Ozempic, and that led to me going off the medication in January and February this year. So I noticed the difference between using Ozempic and not using Ozempic. At this stage, my amateurish thoughts about how Ozempic works are that the calories are being made available by the medication. I have a grad dip in nutrition, but that study is over 20 years old, so a lot has changed.",

Type 1 diabetics can have skyrocketing blood sugar but due to having no insulin they can be emaciated. Type 2 diabetics don't lack insulin, they're resistant to it (though I gather it's not uniformly across the body, different organ systems react differently) so to compensate majority will have ridiculously high insulin levels. And anyone with extra insulin puts on weight. T1DM people have been known to give themselves less insulin than would be needed to bring their sugar down, simply to lose weight, dangerous as it is to forever have high blood sugar. Even T1DM typically end up increasing their insulin needed to control their sugars in the long run, they develop resistance too.\n\nSee Taubes' Rethinking Diabetes book.

Even so watching a 'basic' or introductory lecture from either of them would teach a lot of extreme CICO proponents something. Both make the simple point that animals will usually maintain a stable/healthy weight when on appropriate diets, like cats on a mostly carnivorous diet, but when an excess of carbs are introduced those animals can quickly become obese which is something we almost never see in nature with those species. You can free-feed a cat or dog a species appropriate diet and it simply won't gain weight, but if you free-feed it the 'wrong' diet it will develop metabolic issues. The tools to 'calorie count' weren't even available until recently, and no other species can calorie count, yet most don't get obese even in environments where more than enough food is available.
