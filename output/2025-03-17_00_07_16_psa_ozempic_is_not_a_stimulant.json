        "body": "Genuine question: what is it about Kyle this season that makes people think she's on stimulants?  \nIt feels to me she's a bit distant because she isn't drinking and maybe realising she's not that into the housewives lifestyle anymore.  \nShe also seems more clear in her communication because she isn't getting lit at events.  \nI'm not getting drugs from her, but I know very little about prescription drugs",

        "body": "I think a lot of it is guilt by association: she\u2019s from LA so she must be on drugs. LA can be real health conscious though. Sure, there are drugs, but I would highly doubt if she were on drugs at this point in her life. \n\nThen there is the pupil size analysis, which is only evidence of sympathetic stimulation. Fight or flight activation so it could be from fear, anxiety,anger, whatever. Pupil size can change with emotions. Or maybe she drank a lot of caffeine or a red bull.  \n\nAnytime someone loses weight they say \u201coh maybe it\u2019s drugs\u201d. I have no idea why people have such a fascination with drugs users on these shows. I would think that even if celebrities used drugs, they are most likely casual users\u2014like a party\u2014than high all day everyday.  It\u2019s hard for people to believe that other people are just motivated to work out.  \n\nThen there is an overall Kyle hatred, which I really don\u2019t get. Maybe they hate her cause she\u2019s the last OG standing on the show and they dislike her more than they disliked LVP, so it\u2019s not \u201cfair\u201d for some fans? When people don\u2019t like others, they sometimes make up shit about them. Same adolescent shit. \n\nIf LVP produced the show, it\u2019s fine, but not if Kyle does it.",

It\u2019s common for it to increase your confidence, but it shouldn\u2019t make you aggressive. Her entire personality and physique has changed. It can also increase your energy, thus the stamina improvement for long workouts. Very common for menopausal women to take testosterone, she just seems to be taking too much.",
