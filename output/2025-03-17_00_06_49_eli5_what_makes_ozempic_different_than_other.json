Many people, especially those who are Type 2 diabetic, have poor insulin response to eating. \n\nOzempic also causes the liver to release less glucose into the bloodstream, so one doesn't need as much insulin. It also dlows down the digestive tract. This action does two things. First, it slows down how quickly the body's blood glucose goes up after eating (meaning one needs less insulin at any one time). Second, the stomach stays full longer, allowing the person to feel full. Before the class of drugs thatvincludes Ozempic, many diabetics never feel full no matter how much they ate.",

I draw the med myself (easy!) for injection.

The results on that front say everything: this stuff works for me. Why should I suffer until I actually get diabetes in order to qualify for the pen-injector brand? \n\nPeople say, \u201conce you start taking it, you\u2019ll have to take it the rest of your life, or the weight will come back on.\u201d Well I f I don\u2019t take it I will get diabetes and have to give myself multiple shots every day, not to mention a whole bunch of diabetes side effects.

Wegovy is not prescribed to diabetics, as they need to be on the lower dose with Ozempic. (And no one who wants it for weight loss wants the lower dose that\u2019s less effective.) People who want to take semaglutide who don\u2019t meet the FDAs criteria as overweight or obese are using compounded semaglutide, which does not effect the available supply of either Ozempic or Wegovy. Ozempic is in short supply for diabetics because there are *a whole fucking lot of type 2 diabetics* in this country.\u00a0\n\nAnd to be clear, no one \u201cneeds\u201d semaglutide. It\u2019s not insulin. The advice to overweight people to just lose weight \u201cnaturally\u201d applies equally to those with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 is caused by being overweight, and 99% of the time resolves with weight loss. Diabetics are not more deserving of this medication than people who are overweight without diabetes. And shortages are going to continue to grow, because there are trials going now to get approval for semaglutide as a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s, addictions, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. (Cardiovascular benefits were seen in those who lost zero weight, before anyone asks.)

[This in-depth article from The Atlantic goes into it,](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/04/ozempic-mounjaro-glp-1-long-term-effects/678057/) the TL;DR is it may impact the hormone-based systems behind fuel partitioning that tell our bodies what to do with the macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrates) in the foods we eat.\n\nThose systems getting out of whack might partly be responsible for obesity by telling people\u2019s bodies to store too many calories as fat and Ozempic might be helping right the ship. It could be why you see a lot of anecdotes of people who make almost no big changes to their lifestyle and weight starts flying off.\n\nPersonally, I lost about 120 pounds then hit a plateau. Gained back maybe 20 over two years. This spring I got put on Wegovy and lost 25 in a couple months to smash my previous record-low.

These can include interfering with sleep and strong rebound hunger when they wear off in the evening amongst others. In addition, they are quite long lasting (typically taken once per week) and can suppress hunger when a stimulant medication would have worn off in the evening. They are also more effective at lowering weight in clinical trials.\n\nAs for what the drugs are, they are short peptide hormones that are slightly modified. They have an unusual amino acid to prevent it from being degraded by the normal enzyme which turns off GLP-1 (DPP4, half life of about 5 minutes) and a modification that lets it bind to a protein in the blood called albumin, preventing it from being quickly excreted by the kidneys (half life about an hour) as well as a modification that prevents it from upsetting your immune system.\n\nThe hormone GLP-1 is produced in the small bowel from proglucagon. It is essentially a \"I have just eaten\" signal. It makes the pancreas produce more insulin, slows down emptying of the stomach, and suppresses hunger in the brain amongst other things. GLP-1 analogue medications essentially turn the \"I've just eaten\" hormone on 24/7.",

My shrink explained how it works, and she said that along with the lipitor the gp gave me i should see a huge reduction in my numbers by december. Its been approved for sugar addiction but its hard to find any real people its worked on. Its worked really well for me. Ive lost 4 pounds already just from not eating processed sugar.

Previously I was able to lose a few kilos at a time but it required an eternal fight with a hunger that never went away, and every time I eventually faltered. Now I'm losing about a kg a week with zero adverse effects, still eating well without feeling ick but without the desire to overeat, to snack between meals, or to eat much junk food. I might still occasionally grab a takeaway, but I'll have half a serving and finish it the next meal, or have a small burger but no chips or drink. Mostly I feel like a modest serve of protein and some vegetables. Essentially, it makes eating like we've always been told to feel natural.\u00a0\n\n\n2.5mg is meant to be a 4 week initiation dose before stepping up, but I've been on it for 7 weeks now and will likely stay on it unless it stops working. Eating any less would probably be trying to lose weight too fast (I'm at about 1700 cals a day which for a man of my height/activity is about an 800 calorie/day deficit) so I see no point risking adverse symptoms with a higher dose and my doctor agrees.\u00a0 I follow a number of glp-1 subreddits and I see people being pushed onto higher and higher doses because it's 'the schedule'. I suspect over time lower doses of these medications may become standard for a lot of people who will see significant\u00a0benefit with fewer side effect, and perhaps even lower doses available for maintenance when goal weight is achieved.\u00a0",
