In non overweight diabetics I\u2019ve observed adverse effects like unintentional weight loss and hypoglycemia unawareness, when glucose control could be effectively achieved with a much milder medication like Trulicity (dulaglutide) that does not cause weight loss. \n\nMeanwhile, nearly all patients prescribed these medications for obesity have experienced significant overall improvements in their health, such as better cholesterol levels, blood pressure, joint relief, cardiovascular health, and obstructive sleep apnea\u2014REAL and serious comorbid conditions which accompany obesity and take years off your life.\n\nMetformin, which is now a staple medication for Type 2 diabetes, was originally developed for *influenza* treatment. Pharmaceutical drugs can often found to be more effective for conditions different than their original purpose.\n\nI can\u2019t help but be amused by the passionate amount of misinformation circulating about these medications on this subreddit.",
