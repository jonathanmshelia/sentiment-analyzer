Part of it has probably been Trulicity, most of it has been ovarian cancer, maybe a small part has been effort on my part.\n\nA surprising (to me) amount of people still want to congratulate me on the weight loss, and I know they mean well, because it\u2019s so ingrained in my generation and older that weight loss = good, no matter how it comes about, but I\u2019m so over it. I\u2019m always like, *My guy, this is not my doing. I tried and failed to lose weight for the last 35 years. Do you really, truly think I just suddenly got it right this time?* I don\u2019t deserve (or need) congratulating for losing weight any more than I needed chastising for the last 35 years of NOT losing weight. Neither has been under my control.\n\nI am embarrassed about most facets of my diabetes, because it\u2019s completely out of my control and nobody can figure out why. The cancer doesn\u2019t help, but that\u2019s only been the last couple years, and I\u2019ve never had good control over the diabetes. I eat like I\u2019m supposed to, I walk everywhere because I don\u2019t drive, I\u2019ve lost 80lbs, I\u2019ve taken maybe nine or ten different combinations of meds, and they all improve things for a few weeks to a few months and then my sugars gradually start creeping up again. I\u2019ve had the tests and I\u2019m definitely not a misdiagnosed type 1. So I blame myself. I have poorer control of this illness than most of the teenagers I know, and that\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nI\u2019m not embarrassed about the meds, though. Maybe because I\u2019ve been on entire cocktails of medications since I was a kid. I\u2019m just relieved that diabetes means I get them all for free now (U.K.).",

One big reason why is that I\u2019m consistently making better decisions about what\u2019s going on my plate.\n\nBut not a single one of those food decisions was made with my weight in mind. (And frankly, there\u2019s a good bit of surplus weight at this time.) The only numbers I\u2019m focusing on are the ones on my glucometer and my CGM. It just so happens that a side effect of focusing on getting my blood sugar in range, and keeping it there, is that unneeded pounds are gradually going away. \n\nAre the meds making the weight loss easier? Probably. Are the better decisions also helping? I\u2019m sure of it. Even non-diabetic folks taking meds solely for weight loss have to improve their decisions at mealtime, or they won\u2019t see the progress they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAnyway, feel free to credit yourself with 100% of the improvements in your health.

It upsets me that the medication has been put into a negative light due to people taking it for unintended purposes.  When people comment on my weight loss, I simply respond with \"Thanks.  I made some lifestyle changes for the better of my health.\"  My weight loss is NOT because I simply take a weekly injection.  My weight loss is because I HAVE made changes.  I walk more, eat less, limit my carbs, and take my prescribed medications.",
