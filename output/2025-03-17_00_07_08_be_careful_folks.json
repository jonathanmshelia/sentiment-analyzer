My consultant gastroenterologist was like \"I dunno, maybe stop it for a bit and see if it improves\" when I asked if the meds might be causing it. So I did. \n\nMy symptoms seemed to mellow but didn't go away. So I asked him if that meant it had caused my symptoms \"no way to be sure but if you feel better without it and you don't need to take it it's probably best to stay off it.\"\n\nAnyways over the next year or 2 I was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. They still aren't sure which. My consultant still isn't sure if the meds I was on were exacerbating my illness or if that was just a flare up. I've had similar flare ups since while not taking the meds but that particular flare up really seemed to begin and end with taking that medication.\n\nMy point is a proper doctor will be very cautious to state anything with absolute certainty unless there is absolute certainty. And I don't think what the OP describes is a situation with absolute certainty.\n\nThat being said Ozempic is a relatively new drug and is being used in a new way. We should all be diligent about monitoring our health and reaction to the drug. I've seen credible research that it may lead to increased risk of certain bowel cancers and anecdotally there seems to be some people that just have far more severe side effects.\n\nBut as my GP said to me \"there were far more things you were at risk of dying from when you weighed 120lbs more\" and the types of cancers I may be more at risk of now are easily detectable by a blood test.

Large clinical trials suggest that the rate of pancreatitis among GLP-1 users is about 0.1% to 0.5%. The risk appears to be relatively rare but is higher in individuals with a history of pancreatitis or other pancreatic conditions.\n\nSeveral studies have shown no significant difference in pancreatitis risk between GLP-1 receptor agonists and other diabetes treatments, while others have indicated a slight increase. If pancreatitis symptoms (such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) occur, it\u2019s essential to discontinue use and seek medical advice promptly. \n\nSince pancreatitis risk can vary based on individual health factors, it\u2019s best to discuss with a healthcare provider, especially if there\u2019s any personal or family history of pancreatic conditions.\u201d",

Especially when y'all start abusing the phrase \"correlation vs causation\" - Ozempic is the literal cause and catalyst. Just because you happen to be in a more vulnerable population with metabolic disease predisposition doesn't make it any less so. Or asking for peer reviewed studies, of which there are plenty. Or saying the ER doctors are biased, because they're not, they know that the 0.1% to 0.5% of people taking Ozempic who end up in ER with those exact symptoms and affected organs are there because they are taking Ozempic, not because they skipped a meal. (That's 1 to 5 people out of 1000, yes that is a common stat for a population). Have y'all watched \"The Substance\"? Literally a metaphor for this.",

Best would be rely on keeping bad food  out of your daily routine, and only eat good quality food with calorie deficit. I have kept sugar out now from my food altogether.

I continued to have GERD (at one time it was Barrett's), IBS , colon polyps removals, NAFL, and all kinds of issues with diverticulosis pockets, stomach pain, gastritis attacks.  Started Ozempic about a year ago (off and on for a while in the beginning)- still have gastro issues - landed me in ER recently.  They have also tested for H. Pylori through endoscopy, negative.  I was losing weight and on really high protein, which could have triggered it.  I notice seeds/nuts are a no for me-and I have found a better balance on protein (I lift/strenght trainining) without going overboard.  I notice 24hs after a new dose I have really bad upper stomach pain - it levels out over the next few days.  \n\nMy GI dr is convinced it's the ozempic, but I know I had a lot of issues prior to it- and it's saving my life with the improved A1C at normal levels now. I think the issues now are related to high levels of long-term PPI use.  So now I only take as needed instead of 40mg daily.   Ozempic DOES seem to aggravate symptoms somewhat, especially the slower digestion and still sometimes sulfur burbs, etc...-so it's not blameless, but not the full cause either. My hold dads side of the family had similar GI/colon issues-so genetics can play a role.  I also have been under severe stress for quite some time, and I know it plays a huge role in my stomach problems- so eating healthier and losing weight is helping-I think it's just something I have to deal with for life.\n\nI did start some iberogast drops with meals also, which seems to help.",

        "body": "Insulin resistance is a condition where your body\u2019s cells don\u2019t respond properly to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. When cells become resistant, the pancreas compensates by producing more insulin to help glucose enter the cells, leading to elevated insulin levels. This can contribute to weight gain and potentially progress to type 2 diabetes if not managed.\n\nHowever, when you\u2019re on Ozempic (semaglutide), insulin resistance won\u2019t cause you to gain weight\u2014quite the opposite. Ozempic works by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion only when blood sugar levels are high, reduces appetite, and slows down digestion. This medication helps reduce insulin surges and stabilizes insulin levels, improving insulin sensitivity. As a result, it can facilitate weight loss by allowing your body to use insulin more effectively and reducing fat storage.\n\nSo, instead of causing weight gain, Ozempic can help you lose weight by addressing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. If you have any concerns or are experiencing unexpected effects, it\u2019s important to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can offer personalized advice and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.",
