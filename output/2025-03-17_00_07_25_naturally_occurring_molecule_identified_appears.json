In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y\n\nAbstract\n\nPeptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nNaturally occurring molecule rivals Ozempic in weight loss, sidesteps side effects\n\nA Stanford Medicine study taps artificial intelligence to find a naturally occurring molecule called a peptide that suppressed appetite and led to weight loss in mice and pigs.\n\nA naturally occurring molecule identified by Stanford Medicine researchers appears similar to semaglutide \u2014 also known as Ozempic \u2014 in suppressing appetite and reducing body weight. Notably, testing in animals also showed that it worked without some of the drug\u2019s side effects such as nausea, constipation and significant loss of muscle mass.\n\nThe newly discovered molecule, BRP, acts through a separate but similar metabolic pathway and activates different neurons in the brain \u2014 seemingly offering a more targeted approach to body weight reduction.",
