This is why you can have so many \u201camazing\u201d headlines of \u201cman loses a 100 pounds in a year\u201d but then the statistic remains true that 95% of people regain all weight lost or a bit more in 2-5 years (this is exactly what the result of the Biggest Loser TV show was, nearly every contestant regained their weight or more and this result generalizes to weight loss at even lower levels ). \n\nThis is what makes Ozempic and other glp-1 drugs so revolutionary. They show sustained weight loss. Look up the headline making drug trials with semaglutide. The controls maintain less than 5% body weight loss after two years while the semaglutide users maintain a loss of 15-20% body weight. \n\nRead up on the science of weight loss and set point to fully understand what\u2019s going on here. The research has been in on this for decades but is often poorly communicated yo the general public. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html\n\nThere is of course seemingly discouraging implication from this. For most, ozempic will need to be a drug for life to maintain longterm weightloss. However, this is a considerable improvement over the current state of things where upwards of 95% those who lose weight regain all lost weight or more within 2-5 years.",

Lots of info on this site regarding click counting.  \n\nThere are people on this site that can only tolerate half the regular starting dose.  Others who go up slowly every 6-8 weeks rather than every 4.\n\nIf your wife had tailored her dose to manage her side effects, she may have had a lot of success with it.  You will be much more educated by the time you are approved, and will likely be successful.  In fact, you will be in a position to help your wife should she ever decide to try it again.",

I did this in just a few months, still drank alcohol occasionally, still ate out with friends and family (just didn\u2019t finish the whole plate) and it took very little effort. I have absolutely no regrets and wish I knew about ozempic in 2020! Would have made my first weigh loss journey easier. Go for it!!! And don\u2019t feel bad about doing it either.

I still dont entirely understand how the insurance thing all works. I called them and this is with every health insurance, there isnt another plan that I can go on that covers this donut hole. Just an fyi, that was a huge shock to me and i almost had to stop using it",
