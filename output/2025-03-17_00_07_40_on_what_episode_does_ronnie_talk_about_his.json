(Still love a cocktail with friends, a glass of wine with a nice meal, or drinking at a party.)

        "body": "Hi friend, I can speak to my experience. For context, I\u2019m fit (I walk my dogs 2-3 miles daily, always have) and do pilates nearly every day. I\u2019m 5\u20193.5\u201d and early 30s.\n\nI lost a good amount of weight \u2018naturally\u2019 in 2022. I gained some back in 2023, and despite pulling all the same levers, couldn\u2019t lose weight. August 2023 I went on semaglutide via my medspa. I weighed in at 152 lbs. From August to end of December, I was on sema. It fully shifted my eating habits because it completely curbs your appetite. The food noise disappears. I got down to 129 and am hovering around 133-134 off the meds. The food noise does return and it\u2019s hard to fight. You have to make changes while you\u2019re on it or you will fail once you\u2019re off it. I should\u2019ve set a lower weight target initially, because you do gain a few back, so I\u2019m currently (lol) at a different clinic as I type this trying to get back on it to lose more weight (I know I\u2019ll gain 5ish back) to get to my true target weight. I continue to walk daily, I even got a walking pad so I\u2019m doing 3-4 miles on top of my walks with my dogs, and go to pilates. I try to eat high protein and I try to not eat like I did before, but it is hard. I won\u2019t lie. Happy to discuss further if you wanna message me!",

(I purposefully got below my goal weight of 125 as I assume I will gain some back.) Off the drug, I've found that though my appetite has returned, it has not returned to the same degree. And I've used the lessons I've learned from being on semaglutide (stop eating when I'm full is KEY - also throwing the food away or putting it away so I don't just continue to eat mindlessly) is helping me maintain without it. \n\nTo the OP: give it a try! It can only help you learn healthier habits. There's bound to be some weight gain after you get off the drug, but you'll have much better tools for coping with hunger and food noise once you've experienced what it feels like to have \"normal\" eating habits.",

It was amazing seeing the transformation but man was it hard. The drug makes you very tired, nauseous and gives you headaches. The first day, I was throwing up coffee. Then it just started working and totally curbed my food noise. BUT, I was terrified of the constipation and what it was doing to my pancreas. So I stopped on the 3rd month. I tried to go back, but again, the stomach paralysis scared me. It looks like most have had the same experience. They stop but then go back on it. I\u2019m pretty much done and won\u2019t go back, but man, it\u2019s an amazing drug. If it didn\u2019t have such bad side effects, I would definitely use it all the time, but I\u2019m a hypochondriac and it just wasn\u2019t worth it for my mental health. I definitely think you should try it, but, for sure the food noise comes back, the lower doses don\u2019t work as effectively, and you are always stressed to gain it back.

I\u2019ve tried several programs along with exercise in the past to lose weight.

I wouldn\u2019t allow that to stop me from trying something that works for majority of people.  I am very aware of this being on it, but I don\u2019t view it any differently than doing weight watchers and stopping or keto and stopping, I\u2019ve done it all and gained back every time I quit doing those things.  I\u2019ve been on it for 8 months now, lost 35 pounds (my starting bmi was 30).  I am starting to experience more hunger and some of the initial effects are wearing off.  I am starting to track calories again as I know I will need to in order to continue to lose and then To maintain.  It helped me when nothing else worked, I had gone for 2 years trying and basically gaining and losing the same 5 lbs no matter what I did, I started wegovy and all of the sudden I could lose again doing those same things.  I only want to lose 5-10 more pounds and then maintain but I fully expect to have keep putting on the work to do that, it\u2019s not necessarily complete magic, as in you don\u2019t have to do anything, but it helps people who can\u2019t lose by simple diet and exercise.",

You have to be diligent about managing those aspects, for me it\u2019s drinking an electrolyte drink once a day, lots and lots of water, and miralax if things aren\u2019t moving\u2019.  A big mistake a lot of people make on semiglutides is not eating enough fiber, protein and water.  I\u2019m used to managing this stuff as I have had to for decades but not everyone knows how to handle things like ibs.  Semiglutide works in part through delayed gastric emptying, but that\u2019s while you are taking it, when you stop that should go back to normal but there are a very, very small percentage of people who have experienced gastroparesis or bowl blockages, the latter can absolutely be prevented but still good to be informed.  It\u2019s a personal decision but the way I approached it is there is a small risk of terrible extreme side effects with everything you take, whether it\u2019s arthritis meds, pain relievers, antibiotics, you name it, for me I decided that those risks didn\u2019t stop me from using those things and being obese in and of itself is a huge health risk so why not try.",

The reason why I did Saxenda instead of Ozempic is because I have sensitivity to medication and this one you inject daily, so it\u2019s out of your system in 24 hours as opposed to a week. That way if I had side effects, it would only last a day. I had dizziness, nausea and the sensation of vertigo triggered panic attacks. I stuck with it. Lost 8lbs, but gained it back and 10 more. I understand about food noise. Now I just stopped eating refined sugar and switched to a plant based diet (other GI issues) and I\u2019ve lost ten lbs in 2 months. Slower but no side effects. For me I think it\u2019s better to just modify your lifestyle a bit, try to experiment with eliminating or adding different types of food, and increase your protein intake. Also, I just started menopause, so that\u2019s a whole different story. My doctors want me to go back on it, but I\u2019m taking amla daily and my A1c and bad cholesterol has lowered significantly in the last few months. I have a yoga therapist and Ayurvedic doctor too. Just my way of creating balance and finding what\u2019s best for me.
