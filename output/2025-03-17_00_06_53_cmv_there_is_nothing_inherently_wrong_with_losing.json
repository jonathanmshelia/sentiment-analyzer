In theory, both weight loss medication and anti-depressants are used as a tool to treat people for whom lifestyle changes or other non-drug treatment approaches failed or provided only partial relief. However it seems like some/many people on both of these drug types fail to earnestly attempt lifestyle changes prior to, or during, drug treatment for their issues. Anecdotal but of the few people I know who are on anti-depressants and speak openly about it, none of them practice lifestyle methods to treat or improve their mental health. From what they tell me, they do not exercise, they binge drink, dont view adequate sleep as important, etc. Or, something in their life is making them miserable and they fail to change it. Then, based on the way they talk about their mental health treatment, when they experience intractable or a re-occurrence of mental health symptoms, their first and only approach is to speak with their doctor about medication adjustments.  It is my personal opinion that *some* people with mental health struggles, while it may not be entirely their fault, fail to take responsibility for the things they can do to improve their situation. Clinical depression and depression caused by or strongly influenced by situations, stress, or some sort of factor in their lives are different but are often treated the same way, and seen the same way by sufferers.\n\nI think this also applies to *some* people with GLP-1 medications. I know 2 people who've talked about being on them. One person legitimately has spent years dieting and exercising and cannot lose weight past a point. The other person clearly just lacks the discipline to adopt and maintain a healthier diet and exercise routine. They eat like shit and eat large portions. They've tried certain diets that they eventually give up on. One told me they gave up because they didnt like the foods they were instructed by a dietician to eat, and didnt like exercise. People like this are the ones for whom I think the weight loss medications are a bandaid that do not treat the root cause of their weight issues, or at least are a sort of shortcut, because their issue is foundationally a lack of discipline. They could end up being someone who cannot lose weight past a certain point if they did stick to a healthier lifestyle, but they never get to that point to find out because they fail to stick with the beneficial changes they attempt.",

Do you think I've never joined a gym? I've paid nutritionists, doctors, used diet tracking apps, tried meal kits, tried keto, tried weight watchers, watched podcasts... it goes on and on.\n\nTwo things have shown moderate results:\n\n(1) living in Japan on a 4 month exchange trip. Didn't have a car or access to fast food. Ate a bunch of sushi and cheap snacks but portion sizes are small. I would have to *try* not to lose weight when I lived there. Sadly there is no way my career will ever take me back there. I am a lawyer trained in U.S. law so there is little opportunity for me in other countries, and there would be a lot of downsides to living in Japan long term anyway.\n\n(2) Taking Adderall for ADHD. Stimulants cut appetite when you first go on them, and they give you a bunch of energy. It was great. I was actually able to exercise and focused on eating healthier not just less. Lost a bunch of weight and finally felt like I had control. Of course this effect wears off over time. But it helped me feel better about my body. The weight returned but the body positivity stayed. \n\nThese two experiences combined, showed me that the only way to achieve meaningful weight loss (at least for me) is a change in my material conditions. I will never willpower my way to the body I want. Something has to happen that eliminates my access to unhealthy food and forces me to move my body. I will never be able to make these daily choices on my own. I need to put myself in circumstances where losing weight is easy.",

Some people had those specific changes before they became obese, and they contributed greatly to future weight gain, e.g. insulin resistance.\n\nBeing fit after being obese is NOT THE SAME as always being fit. It's much harder, your body will reduce its energy expenditure (limiting your strength, thermogenesis, causing feeling of tiredness) and produce more hunger signals, if you lose weight. Weight loss drugs, especially tirzepatide and retatrutide, that work on a broader set of receptors, revert this state back to normal. Your body stops feeling and acting like it's starving. Energy expenditure goes back to the baseline, food-craze in one's head calms down. To make it clear, I'm not saying this effect is unbearable for everyone.\n\nWhy would affected people have to live without a medication, that makes their bodies function normally again? What you said in that sentence makes the same sense for obesity as for depression, hypertension, osteoarthritis, etc. Sure you can adjust your life to accommodate special needs and put extra effort, having lower quality of life.

I track my calories on an app. I know I need around 2500 a day to lose weight. Around 3200 to gain weight. That number will be different for you. I try to get 10,000 steps a day of walking. I train at least 6 days a week. You don't need to go that much. 3 is plenty, especially if you haven't done much weight training in the past. Don't keep those foods you know you will eat in the house. For me, that's cookies and chips they don't stay in the house. It's just takes time and a little knowledge and discipline. You would be surprised how much you will change after a year. \n\nIf you just don't wanna put the work in, that's fine, but I really hope you reconsider before you make this decision. You don't need the drug. You can beat this. Millions of people have done it this way. It can he done just takes a bit of hard work and discipline.",

Even if you lose weight artificially, you are likely still consuming trash food that is wreaking havoc on your body because you didn\u2019t learn the lifestyle changes necessary to consume healthy food. You likely are not going to start working out either because why would you? People will say \u201cI would work out if I lost weight\u201d but you can work out now. Why put in extra work if the weight stays off without it?\n\nSo yeah, add in the scarcity and unknown long term effects and I would say that the weight loss drugs are bad because they\u2019re not actually solving the core problem.

Fresh seafood is very common and cheap in Japan so that naturally became my primary protein (I love sushi). If I wanted to maintain my current weight in Japan I would have to put in serious effort. It was so extremely easy to be healthy. \n\nI think obesity has become so bad in America because the government is not incentivized to care about our health. Private citizens pay for healthcare so the state doesn't benefit if people are healthy. In fact, the state benefits if we die sooner because it reduces the burden on social security.

        "body": "&gt;I will say that the obesity epidemic in our country is a mix of both failure at the personal level and failure of our government. Failure at the personal level due to a lack of self-control, a lack of desire to educate themselves, and a lack of motivation to improve. Failure of the government by allowing companies to effectively poison us, push products to make people addicted to unhealthy food, and run campaigns to obfuscate the ill effects to the public.\n\nThe Big Lie is that, once a person *starts* down the path to obesity, they just have to buckle down and they can get off that path.  That's not really true.  The lesson of the GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon pathways is that there really is a non-conscious feedback system that controls appetite and metabolism.  That system is susceptible to a particular set of failure modes, and once those modes are triggered it's very rare for anyone to be able to override them long-term.  \n\nWe're not talking about a personal failure, in the sense of a failure of willpower or people making a conscious choice to get fat.  Obesity as we know it is intrinsic to the way that humans are structured, interacting with the larger systems of which we are a part.  There's a familiar litany of the reasons why highly processed/optimized-for-craviness foods are bad for us -- but once that badness becomes evident and a person starts gaining weight, the failure mode dominates that person's life and there is often no way out.  *Losing* weight, in particular, seems to trigger stronger cravings and lower metabolism *in the long run*, meaning that the \"set point theory\" has some actual reality.  \n\nIt's worse than that.  If you've talked to even a few fat people, you'll have heard complaints about \"my metabolism is really slow\", and there's something to that.  Some people's bodies will go to extreme lengths to avoid releasing fat -- to the extent that they'll develop hypothermia or hypoglycemia rather than convert fat to glycogen in times of dieting/famine.  One reason tirzepatide seems to be more effective than semaglutide is that it is an agonist for the GIP system, which encourages the liver to metabolize fat into glycogen, making that available to fuel the body.  That belies the perennial \"how could you not be losing weight?  You ate like half the RDA of calories.  You must be cheating\" thermodynamic line of reasoning.  If GLP-1 regulates g'zinta (modifying appetite and reducing how much food g'zinta the body), GIP regulates g'zouta, by helping metabolize fat to sustain a high metabolism even without food.\n\nAll of that is to say, it's not necessarily a personal failure for people to get fat or to be unable to lose extra weight.  It can and should be treated as a pathology, not as a moral failing.",

Ozempic helped me lose enough weight so that I *could* work out sustainably. I have always tried to stay active, even at my fattest, and for many years walked a lot, even if I couldn't do anything else. But I was limited by fatigue and joint pain and that got worse and more limiting as I gained weight, which then limited me even further.\n\nI've lost over 60 lb.  Joined a gym around 40 lb down. Increased my activity as the weight has dropped. \n\nWhy? Because I can now. Without getting injured and without getting sick. And because I enjoy the strength and stamina that comes with working out, now that I'm able to. Because I understand the medicine is a tool, not a miracle cure. \n\n\nOzempic changed the way my body responds to food which finally allowed me to make effective and sustained lifestyle changes.

Those people are delusional morons, and the advice they are giving *will* kill you if you follow it. Heart disease kills one in five Americans. You, your doctor, and actual medical textbooks and other actual medical professionals are the only people who should be involved in decisions about what medicines you take.\n\nSide effects of Ozempic include:\n\n* Breathing problems or wheezing.\n* Racing heart.\n* Fever or general ill feeling.\n* Swollen lymph nodes.\n* Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue, or throat.\n* Trouble swallowing or throat tightness.\n* Itching, skin rash, or pale red bumps on the skin called hives.\n* Nausea or vomiting.\n\nThese are side effects we know about. They are very well documented. There are others, but they're less severe or much much less common, this is the list you need to worry about. As you say, being obese also has side effects you are quite familiar with, so you're in a position to decide which is worse. But there is something in inherently wrong with losing weight via drugs, they have side affects, and you can develop dependency on them. The benefit may be worth these problems, but they are for sure problems. So, there are two unavoidable core categories of things inherently wrong with taking Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs, ignoring availability and supply and demand. This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad decision for you to take the drugs, and to become dependent on them, but dependency and side effects are inherent problems when you rely on drugs to control your wieght.\n\n. You seem convinced you can't lose weight \"the right way,\" and you're turning to drugs instead, so that means you see the drugs as the \"wrong\" way on some level. I don't know what you've tried, but I do know morbid obesity will decrease the duration of your life while also decreasing the quality. And, if you try the pills and find the side effects worse than you thought they were, you can go off them, right? It seems like you're looking at this like you only have two choices: be morbidly obese until you die young, or take this drug. These aren't your only choices, you have other options to explore.\n\nI had a friend in pretty much your position, who felt like he couldn't lose weight, felt embarrassed about going outside in public, so he started only going outside after dark and eating lots of delivery. As soon as he decided it wasn't possible for him to lose weight, he started gaining weight rapidly. You may feel like your efforts aren't helping, but giving up on them entirely is almost certainly worse than what you're currently doing. Yoni took only 18 months to go from 350 to 500 pounds. He didn't live long after he hit 600. He was 26. He was funny, kind, generous, a really good friend - I wish he'd taken drugs instead of dying.\n\nYou could make no changes to your diet and non-work lifestyle and get a full time manual labor heavy lifting job. It will hurt at first, but you'll get paid, and I've always been more able to do hard, unpleasant things if I'm getting paid. For me, this is probably the easiest way to control my weight, I'm the sort of person who loves to throw myself hard into physical projects. I hate going to the doctor. I'm not good at consistently taking pills. I knew a couple huge guys in high school who lost 20 pounds a month doing stuff like digging ditches and moving boats. I also know a morbidly obese guy who did lots of heavy manual labor but just ate more worse food and kept gaining weight. He claimed he couldn't control his portions because he had ADHD, which I was always dubious of.\n\nI don't know the specifics of your diet and your metabolism, but there are lots of changes you can make there as well, and there are ways to do it that work for you. For many people, eliminating sugary drinks helps a lot. If you have the fortune to have good health insurance, that comes with a mental health benefit. I don't know if therapy would help you lose weight, but it sounds like it might and there are very few people who *don't* benefit from a therapist.\n\nI know you asked us to ignore supply and demand, but we live in a capitalist society and it affects *everything*. If you have good enough health insurance and finances that you can ignore the cost when you're looking at an expensive drug, they you have good enough health insurance and finances to thoroughly explore other options. You don't have to do this alone, get help, it sounds like you can't afford to not get help.",

Medications like ozempic \\*could\\* offer a less invasive option for people, and would also have the benefit of curbing the hunger signals sent from the brain, creating a more normal sense of hunger in the body for people who have overactive signals. That'd be helpful to a lot of people who have messed up signals due to illness, trauma, etc, and I think when done correctly (becoming more active and making better food choices while on ozempic) would lead to better overall results in the long term. It would also be more beneficial to creating a healthier sense of intake limitation, rather than just eating less because you know there's actual danger of you hurting yourself in a surgical sense if you overeat, so you might still have the signals going, but know you CAN'T eat more, so you just have to sit through it. (Which sounds like something that would really suck, and I could see that leading to disordered eating if not monitored.)\n\nThere's always going to be the people who gain the weight back after quitting treatment, but there's also people who end up failing bariatric surgery afterwards as well, since they're just meant to be tools used towards lifestyle changes.",

If you wait until you lose weight before you try something new, who's to say you will actually try it once you reach your weight goals?

I think given the obesity epidemic in the US, there's a very good argument for part of the population to take Ozempic as part of their fitness/wellness journey. The problem I'm seeing is that as it's become mainstream to take ozempic, the Uber-skinny (heroin chic) look has returned as a beauty standard. People who would otherwise be considered healthy weight buckle under these new standards and want to become even skinnier. I have two acquaintances who were so concerned about being a couple pounds above ideal bmi that they started taking ozempic. Now they're under their target weight and so afraid of gaining those few extra pounds that they're considering taking ozempic indefinitely. Our new societal standard, driven in part by ozempic, is reviving the mental health crisis from a few decades back.\n\nSo while I agree there's a definite need for this drug in a certain portion of the population, I'm concerned about the spillover effect on the opposite end of the spectrum: folks who are already a healthy weight becoming ultra focused on being skinnier as that unhealthy beauty standard returns.",

I\u2019ve kept that up, haven\u2019t gone back to buying junk snacks. I wasn\u2019t working out due to my weight but as I started losing it, I made myself exercise and now I exercise about 5 times a week on average. I learned portion control, smaller plates at home and when I go out to eat I rarely finish my entire meal because restaurants really do serve too much carbs. Also as I was getting off the drug, we lowered the dose over the last month and a half so I didn\u2019t jump from full appetite suppression to suddenly having none.\n\nI did gain back around 5 pounds after getting off the drug and my weight fluctuates +-3 pounds nowadays but I\u2019ve kept most of the weight from coming back and it\u2019s been months since I stopped.

        "body": "Oooh I can talk a lot about this one having been on both sides.\n\nI was almost 350 pounds 10 years ago.  I\u2019ve been mostly maintaining under 250 since, less one spike back up to 265ish.  6\u20191\u201d male, built big and wide, so ideally I should be 185-190.  Currently at 230ish.  So, I\u2019m definitely still overweight and have been for 10 years but no longer morbidly obese like I was for the previous 10.\n\nThe thing that I\u2019ve learned the most is that it is more mental than anything else.  It needs to be tackled like any other addiction, food in this case.  I hear a lot of people saying oh just work out more, but in reality it\u2019s 90% in the kitchen and only 10% the gym.\n\nThere\u2019s levels to how to address it just like with any other addiction.  Cold turkey if possible or a taper if not is always the best option.  This is naturally dealing with the problem.  If that doesn\u2019t work then you can get into pharmaceuticals and if all else fails, more drastic measures.\n\nThe root physical cause of obesity is simply eating more calories than you burn.  The mental aspect must be defeated though to have life long results.  A lot of people loose the weight only to put it back on.  So, you should never start trying to lose weight by getting on pharmaceuticals- it won\u2019t solve the mental reasons for theroot cause and will also fail in many cases.  It should be reserved for extreme cases of many attempts and failures because if you lose weight that way then you either need to keep taking it for life or you will most likely gain it back since you didn\u2019t learn to correct the behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, we all know it\u2019s possible and it\u2019s a lack of willpower in 99% of failed attempts.  That\u2019s the mental part.  So if we kickstart the process with drugs, what makes you think that you\u2019ll magically be fixed instead of correcting the behavior?  Before you\u2019ve had a drastic weight loss the mentality is oh if I just get it off then I\u2019ll be good. No, that\u2019s the easier of the two halves.  Maintaining the weight loss is much more difficult.  A hundred pounds can pretty easily be knocked off in 6 months but you have to keep with it forever to maintain for life.  \n\nSo, it is inherently wrong (for your long term health) to loose weight via drugs IF you haven\u2019t had many failed attempts before and are in a more dire circumstance.  You are not addressing the root cause of it being a food addictions leading to more calories in then out.  You also ought to opt to naturally fix your issues before committing to lifelong pharmaceutical use for a problem that can likely be resolved naturally.  \n\nWeight loss drugs should be used if you truly have tried your hardest (only you know deep inside) multiple times with failure and are morbidly obese.  If that fails then the next option would be stomach reduction surgery.  \n\nWe know that being morbidly obese for a long time and, especially, later in life is terrible for your health.  So that should be resolved and the attempts to resolve should be in the order of least invasive and potentially harmful to most, while addressing the long term stability and mental aspect, therefore my reasoning.",

        "body": "The risks of these medications for non-diabetics are astonomically higher than you appreciate or most people hear about. The risk of taking this medication is that you will never be able to enjoy food again for the rest of your life. It is also not just a side effect while you're taking it, but a permanent condition that persists after you come off. No more Thanksgiving, no more potlucks, no Christmas dinner with the family. At best, you get to watch them eat while you have special bland mashed potatoes and a protein shake. At worst, you're on a feeding tube and can't have food or drink orally ever again. You will be constantly nauseated, barely able to hold down liquids on some days, and in extreme agony if you eat a trigger food. This condition is called gastoparesis (translates to stomach paralysis) and is a condition I've personally been struggling with for over a decade due to an unknown cause.\n\nThis risk is considered acceptable for diabetic patients because diabetes can ALSO cause gastoparesis if it is uncontrolled, so they're already at risk. That was an absolutely critical consideration as part of the FDA approval. The drugs are absolutely NOT safe for anyone without diabetes risks because of this side effect alone and should not be used casually for weight loss. Many are trying to claim that a \"risk\" of developing diabetes from being obese is enough, but unless you're showing signs of \"pre-diabetes,\" it is not.\n\nGastoparesis is incurable with limited treatment options, which are either surgery or a medication called Reglan that has a \"black box\" for a side effect of permanent uncontrollable muscle spasms. They also don't always get you \"normal,\" and it can be more \"not dying from malnutrition.\" Many patients taking GLP-1s ignore the initial signs because feeling full quickly and being a little nauseous helps them lose weight, and they assume it will go away once they come off it. It doesn't, and they caused permanent damage by not stopping immediately.\n\nGastoparesis has moved from a \"rare\" disease to \"uncommon\" because of the recent massive increase in patients. It's so common from these new meds that it's already become the default presumed cause for non-diabetic patients. I'm constantly explaining to doctors I've had it before it \"became cool.\" Also, fun fact, many people end up gaining weight long term with gastoparesis because of dietary restrictions and metabolism issues it causes. So you are not only risking permanently disabling your stomach but being fat again at the end of it. \n\nNo \"quick win\" comes without risks, and weight loss is an off-label use that has NOT been found to be safe by the by the FDA. Your assumption that the side effects are not as bad as being obese is completely false. They are far worse, and the fact that our society is all too quick to brush them entirely under the rug to promote these drugs instead of addressing the underlying causes of obesity is an even bigger problem. Deciding that losing the ability to eat for the rest of your life is an appropriate risk to take because you got fat is inherently wrong, and you deserve better.",

I know firsthand because of my journey\u2026 they say it\u2019s the easy way out or that I\u2019m taking away from people with diabetes. Ironically, peptides are a preventive treatment for just that. They are medically necessary for weight loss and also help with blood pressure, addiction, and much more.\n\nThere are a lot of benefits. People need to educate themselves instead of being quick to believe everything they see flashed in their faces on social media. I love America, but the peptide is portrayed in a way that makes people feel scared, uneasy, and bitter\u2014to make people feel just that way\u2014jealous, with a sour taste in their mouth. America makes it so expensive because Big Pharma wants to make money. It costs $7 to buy\u2014I know firsthand. Other countries get it for as low as $50 a month, and some even cheaper.\n\nSo, of course, people are going to be bitter, slander, and shame others for taking what they see as \u201cthe easy way out.\u201d I had to get gastric sleeve surgery\u2014oh, the \u201ceasy way out\u201d\u2014only because I looked bad before, and now they\u2019re jealous because I look bomb. Let me tell you, it was not easy, and it wasn\u2019t just for vanity. I had multiple health problems, one of them being overweight. Since being on this, all of those problems are gone.\n\nEven though I had the sleeve, I\u2019ve pretty much maintained my weight for 10 years. I use it as maintenance\u2014if I have gained 20 pounds, I go back to the regular dosing on Ozempic, and then when I hit my goal weight, I switch back to maintenance.\n\nSo carry on, haters. It sucks for you not to take the easy way out. Working smarter, not harder, is better. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udfa4 Just let that negativity and lack of education whirl through your ears! Get healthy, look good, and maintain I\u2019m all in .\n\nYes, Ozempic (semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which is a type of peptide-based drug used primarily for managing type 2 diabetes and, more recently, for weight loss.\n\nA peptide is a short chain of amino acids that act as signaling molecules in the body. Ozempic mimics a natural peptide hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which helps regulate blood sugar, appetite, and insulin secretion.\n\nSo, while Ozempic is technically a peptide-based drug, it is still classified as a pharmaceutical medication rather than a pure peptide supplement.\n\nThe peptide in Ozempic (semaglutide) is synthetically made using recombinant DNA technology. It is designed to mimic the naturally occurring GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone in the body.\n\nHow is it made?\n\t1.\tProduced in a Lab: Scientists use genetically modified yeast or bacterial cells (commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce semaglutide.\n\t2.\tDNA Insertion: The genetic code for GLP-1 is altered to create a longer-lasting version (semaglutide) and inserted into the yeast/bacteria.\n\t3.\tFermentation Process: These microorganisms then produce the peptide in large quantities.\n\t4.\tPurification: The peptide is extracted, purified, and modified for stability, ensuring it lasts longer in the body compared to natural GLP-1.\n\t5.\tFinal Formulation: The purified peptide is combined with stabilizers and delivered in an injectable form like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Rybelsus (oral form).\n\nBecause of this process, semaglutide is not a naturally derived peptide but a lab-engineered synthetic peptide-based drug designed to function like GLP-1 in the human body.",

Losing weight alone can do wonders for your energy levels and motivation, and would make it so much easier into getting into a physical activity that you enjoy and can make a part of your daily/weekly routine. I play tennis 2-3 times weekly, it makes my body crave healthier food (home cooked high quality meat, butter from grass fed cows). It elevates my mood and makes me want to cook and clean in between the days I play. Losing weight should allow you to make lifestyle changes that will make it easier to keep the weight off.\n\nGaining muscle and being active raises your resting metabolic rate, which lets you eat more calories without putting on unhealthy weight. These should be your end goal than taking meds for the rest of your life. Obviously, easier said than done, but all the best.",
