My energy levels plummeted and I just had zero physical energy to do anything.\n\nAfter about 6 weeks, I developed really nasty shoulder pain that prevents me from throwing a ball or lifting any weight more than ~5lbs over my head comfortably (and is weirdly a known side effect.)\n\nI also lost zero pounds. I\u2019d lost ~40lbs from just taking Metformin and being a bit more active and then stalled out. Hoped it would help me lose the remaining 30 to get to my \u201chappy place\u201d but no luck.\n\nI\u2019ve now been \u201coff\u201d for ~8 weeks, have put on about 10lbs more than when I started Wegovy, and my shoulder pain hasn\u2019t gone away - but I have my energy back and don\u2019t feel like a tired and useless sack all the time.\n\nI did a lot of power zone training on the peloton previously and I\u2019m ~15% lower than I was when I started after not being having the energy to do any of it for ~12 weeks. Which is unusual since I\u2019ve taken similar breaks before and not seen this big of a dip.\n\nAgain: I\u2019m happy it works for some, and I hope they find ways to mitigate side effects in the future.

(Note there should be six comments total, part four may have gotten removed)\n\nSTART\n\nThe King of Ozempic Is Scared as Hell  \n  \nNow that Novo Nordisk is the world\u2019s weight-loss juggernaut, will it have to betray its first patients\u2014type 1 diabetics?  \n  \nON A FRIGID day in Copenhagen when Erik Hageman was 2 years old, he tripped over his wooden clogs. His face smashed into the floor. In the emergency room, a surgeon repaired his tongue, which had split, but in the months while he was recuperating he shrieked nonstop for water. His urine turned sticky and sweet. The doctor diagnosed diabetes, type 1, the autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own pancreas.  \n  \nThis was 1942. The Nazis occupied Denmark and eugenics was their first medical principle. Trauma like Erik\u2019s fall, some suggested, activated diabetes, and the bloodline of the diabetic was poisoned. Three short weeks of neglect, the doctor promised Hageman\u2019s parents, and their little son would perish of ketoacidosis or starvation. \u201cThe best you can do is do nothing,\u201d the doctor said.  \n  \nStill, Hageman\u2019s parents felt\u2014and this was rebellious, given the master-race ideology that crackled through the Nazi Weltanschauung\u2014that their boy deserved to live. When Hageman\u2019s father, a custodian at a sports college, told his coworkers his son had diabetes, one of them knew a guy.  \n  \nHans Christian Hagedorn, short-tempered physician. Wild tufts of hair. At Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium just outside of Copenhagen, he was refining insulin from the pancreases of cows and pigs to make it work better for humans. During a long period under Hagedorn\u2019s care, Erik Hageman started to get twice-daily injections of a fine precipitate of protamine insulin, a breakthrough formulation that prolonged insulin\u2019s effects in the body. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn is still on the World Health Organization\u2019s list of essential medicines. By the time he was 5, Hageman was injecting himself with a wide-gauge needle as broad as\u2014he pantomimed to me, in a kind of diabetic fish story\u2014a tree trunk.  \n  \nAt 85, Erik Hageman is a dapper grandfather of surpassing warmth, compact like a tap dancer. He\u2019s one of the longest-living diabetics in Denmark. We spent an afternoon together in a modernist mansion in Copenhagen called Domus Hagedorn, which is owned by Novo Nordisk, the Danish firm that grew from Hagedorn\u2019s lab. \u201cHagedorn was rather crazy,\u201d Hageman told me. But without the doctor\u2019s care, he explained, \u201cI\u2019d be blind and I\u2019d have to cut off my legs and have kidney failure.\u201d The now-global company makes half the insulin in the world. Yet today it\u2019s rich and famous for producing Ozempic, the megahit semaglutide drug.  \n  \nJust before visiting Erik Hageman, I met Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, who has presided over the company\u2019s epochal metamorphosis, at the company\u2019s headquarters in Bagsv\u00e6rd, a suburb of Copenhagen. The building\u2019s design, with its giant helix-like indoor spiral staircase, is inspired by insulin\u2014the molecule, the miracle. In a conference room flooded with light, J\u00f8rgensen spoke fondly of Hageman, the company\u2019s poster child. Novo\u2019s executives had clearly presented Hageman to convince me that the company\u2019s greatest achievement is not its stratospheric valuation but its century-long record of saving lives with insulin.  \n  \nBut at Novo these days, semaglutide blocks out the sun. Ozempic was the world\u2019s second-highest-selling drug in 2024. It works extremely well for type 2 diabetes, a non-autoimmune disorder in which the body makes poor use of insulin. And one effect of semaglutide, as we all know now, has been the box-office draw from day one: appetite suppression. The drugs that contain it\u2014especially Ozempic and its more powerful sister Wegovy\u2014have transformed Novo into a global slimming juggernaut. In 2023, the company surpassed Parisian luxury brand LVMH to become the richest company in all of Europe, hitting the ludicrously high market cap of $424 billion. In 2024, Novo took a punch in the face, but it ended the year still richer by market cap than Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Toyota.  \n  \nBeyond the dazzling before-and-afters, though, J\u00f8rgensen is looking at a tricky future, parts of which, he told me, \u201cscare the hell\u201d out of him.  \n  \nThough Novo has as its controlling shareholder the largest altruistic foundation in the world, it has to act coldly and tactically, like an oil or defense company. The demanding semaglutide business has become a mean ouroboros: the insatiable market, exorbitant manufacturing costs, competition from Eli Lilly, pricing pressure from governments, and the private-insurance dystopia in the US\u2014by far Novo\u2019s biggest market, where some 15 million people now take semaglutide. At the same time is the moral crux. Semaglutide alone almost never works for the 8.4 million type 1 diabetics around the world. What keeps J\u00f8rgensen up at night is his fear that, the way drug manufacturing and American health care companies and global markets work, his company might not be able to do right by its original patients. These are the non-Hollywood patients\u2014the ones who, like Eric Hageman, can\u2019t live without insulin.  \n  \nFOR ITS FIRST 75 years, Novo was indispensable but unknown, a producer of insulin, an anonymous commodity. In 1991 the obscurity started to lift. That year, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a Danish chemical engineer, was seeking a treatment specifically for type 2 diabetes, which accounts for as much as 95 percent of all cases of the disease. Over the next 18 years, she led a Novo team in developing an exquisitely cool medicine for type 2 called liraglutide. Liraglutide is an analogue of a human hormone called GLP-1, for glucagon-like peptide-1. After humans eat, we very, very briefly secrete GLP-1 in the brain stem and the gut.  \n  \nGLP-1 can be seen as a tranquilizer for the flesh, a soother of deep and primitive longings. GLP-1 says to the body: peace. Food is available. But GLP-1 in its natural form only murmurs these soothing blandishments for a minute or two. It affords the hungry soul a glimpse of OK-ness, but a fleeting one.",
