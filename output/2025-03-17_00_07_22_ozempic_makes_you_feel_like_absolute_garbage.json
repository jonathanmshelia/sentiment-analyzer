My type 2 diabetes is *severe*, my fasting sugar almost never got below 300/A1C of 14+. My eyesight is shot, I have basically no sensation in my legs from mid-calf on down, and was starting to lose feeling in my hands. My immune system is trash because of it; at one point I was diagnosed with Covid, strep, enterovirus, a double ear infection, and a uti *at the same time*. \n\nAfter six months on Ozempic my fasting glucose tops out at about 125. My A1C is 6.8. I\u2019ve lost close to 50lbs as well, which has only compounded the effect. Yes, I have had all the side effects you mentioned, but given that the alternative was \u2018die from complications of diabetes in your early 30s\u2019, it was worth it. \n\nMy point, I guess, is let\u2019s not demonize it completely; there are people for whom it is absolutely essential.",

I have only lost about 10 pounds over the past 5 months. However since I'm not doing anything radical like crash diets or insane workouts, I feel like my weight loss diet is sustainable over the long term because I'm not over depriving myself. \n\nWhen it comes to taking ozempic  for weight loss I'm curious to know what happens when people have to stop taking it?",

When your cells are insulin resistant (which 70% of obese individuals are, even without diabetes), it promotes a feedback loop that makes losing weight harder. Ozempic (all your GLP-1s really) has the benefit of making it easier for cells to use insulin and interrupt the feedback loop. This can be seen in very modest effects even with Metformin with \\~5% weight loss vs \\~15% with Ozempic. So it's a real double whammy. It reduces appetite because of the slowed gastric emptying and interrupts the insulin resistance/weight gain feedback loop.\n\nhttps://www.scripps.org/news\\_items/4621-can-insulin-resistance-cause-weight-gain#:\\~:text=This%20condition%20is%20known%20as,excess%20blood%20sugar%20as%20fat.",

If you also eat healthy, it's a lot easier to eat less (calorie wise), since healthy food makes you feel full, while junk food doesn't the same way. \n\nA good way can be to either buy smaller plates, eat slower, or just eating 10% less thsn you currently do (assuming you're not currently gaining weight).\n\nJunk food doesn't give the right nutrients either, which might make it easier for you to feel like shit if you're also eating less than normal. A healthy diet shouldn't make you feel like shit, even in a calorie deficit (unless you are addicted to sugar, which most people are honestly, but the withdrawals goes away in a week or two). \n\n\nI'm happy to hear that your blood sugar has dropped, and  I apologize if I gave unwanted advice. I just wanted to let you know, that if you wish to lose weight, you can still do it - regardless of whether you excersize or not.

My doctor prescribed the drug but my insurance wouldn't cover it so I went to a local weight loss company who gets the drug from a compounding pharmacy. The cost is about $357/month regardless of the dosage size. That's a lot of money for some people, but you can also factor in you're spending less on food per month to somewhat offset the cost.\n\nThe positive benefits have been incredible for better energy, libido, and lower blood sugar (I was pre-diabetic), and side effects have been minimal with the only negative one being night time reflux if I eat too much after 8 pm, which I remedied by not eating too much after 8 pm.  I now have what I feel to be a normal appetite because I feel fuller with less food, and no longer eat mindlessly, or at night. It's early in my journey but I feel like this drug is giving me a strong start to better eating habits that can be sustainable for a lifetime. \n\nI've tried virtually every other non-surgical option and this one appears to work well for  me. Good luck to anyone else who decides to try.",
