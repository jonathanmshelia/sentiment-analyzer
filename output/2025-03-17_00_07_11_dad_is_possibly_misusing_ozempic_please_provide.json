In the beginning I had no desire for sweets, fried foods or alcohol. O and glp-1 meds delay the emptying of your stomach so food stays present longer and makes you stay satisfied longer. However, a year and a half in and my cravings for bad foods is back, and I have no desire for the healthy foods, it will tend to go for what sounds good and appetizing. The O is supposed to turn off food noise, which it did in the beginning but doesn\u2019t seem to be working anymore. I think maybe I might have an underlying food addiction of sorts. I can\u2019t seem to stop at 1 or 2 cookies, I have to eat more. I\u2019m always searching for foods to satisfy. My point is, I have a very good understanding of health and nutrition but I still have trouble controlling my urges so for your dad I would still give him education and resources, send him little shorts videos or TT\u2019s on the subjects.

Ozempic controls my diabetes way better than my previous medicine. No matter what I eat, my blood sugar never goes high or low. Your dad might be seeing this and feeling a sense of freedom, especially if he has been living with a lot of eating restrictions. It sounds like he may have some binge/restrict type patterns, if his mother was anorexic.\n\n I will tell you that, for me at least and I'm sure others, appetite does eventually come back once you've reached your goal dose. I'm on 2 mg and have lost 45 lbs and while my appetite is definitely lower than before ozempic it has come back a lot. if I'm not careful about what I eat and overeat or eat when I'm not hungry, I can tell you I would definitely be gaining weight back. So while what he is doing right now might be \"working\" for him, unless he sticks to healthy eating habits, he won't lose much or will regain.\n\n Iirc in trials of Ozempic for diabetes where the people weren't following diet and exercise routines they didn't lose much. I know people on it who didn't change their eating habits who didn't really lose anything. Or he could lose and regain. Also, even if he has very good control of his blood sugar right now, eating a lot of processed food/high glycemic index carbs will cause the disease to progress faster than if you keep those things mostly out of your diet, even if his blood sugar is under good control right now. \n\nGoing to a nutritionist might help him. If he has eating issues retained from his upbringing an intuitive eating nutritionist might be best, as they will help him feel less restricted, allow him to eat a variety of foods, and no foods are off limits. they just help you gently shift your diet healthier and learn moderation.",

Eating bad things, and some foods that are good for you, can result in some unpleasant side effects. He has to learn what he can\u2019t eat, or at least as much as he did before. Weight loss is usually split between fat and muscle, which is why most recommend resistance weight training to help counteract this. In the end though his diet has to be something he can sustain (so occasionally eating bad things, or with greater moderation can still be a win). It isn\u2019t a magic pill, despite producing life changing results for many. As he goes up in dose, the side effects will get more pronounced as the body acclimatizes.\n\nIt\u2019s a learning curve, and honestly the drugs are pretty much a life long thing for most (like BP meds or statins).",
