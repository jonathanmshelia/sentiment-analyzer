        "body": "My a1c started at 10.7. Started Ozempic AND cut carbs to virtually zero for 3 months. The first month I still had high blood sugars despite the low dose of medication and the fact that I wasn\u2019t eating carbs. However, my repeat a1c was down to 5.2 \ud83d\udc4f. I have slowly been re-introducing carbs back into my diet. My main daily goal is still low carb, but I don\u2019t feel bad indulging in carbs every once in a while and my blood sugars have remained low. For example, last night we went out for date night where I had a steak and we shared a baked potato. My blood sugar was 94 after \ud83d\udc4d. My biggest struggle is that my doctor refuses to prescribe me a CGM so I\u2019m going to have to buy one myself. I know I don\u2019t need it, but I would really like to see how my body reacts to different foods at least for a couple of months. I was up to 1mg Ozempic dose for 3 months. Recently, I actually had 2 instances of hypoglycemia which I didn\u2019t enjoy, so I cut back my dose to 0.75mg the last 2 weeks. I feel like I may even cut back to 0.5mg next week because I\u2019ve had readings in the 60s AFTER a meal. I don\u2019t want to experience hypoglycemia again, but I also want to maintain tight control of hyperglycemia so I\u2019ve just got to balance it out. \n\nP.S. the weight loss was expected with this medication, but a secondary benefit. I figured a healthy BMI could only help my diabetes, so I was also counting calories and increasing protein at the same time that I was restricting carbs. I went from an obese BMI of 32 down to a \u201chealthy\u201d 22.",

I have zero interest in losing weight, though if it happens it happens (and it has, I've lost about 30lbs, sucks when clothes no longer fit). I did end up eating healthier because greasy meals and lots of meat made me queasy on ozempic. No restrictions on carbs, I eat mostly plant based with whole grains, lots of veges, fruit, and meat is an occasional thing. The main difference between that and before is a reduction in having a meat course with meals, and less of the fancy French cooking techniques I love because anything with heavy cream or lots of butter seems to upset my stomach now. I did start exercising more because I went through PT again for an old injury and managed to get enough pain relief to incorporate more movement into my days. \n\nBetween the ozempic, possibly tweaks in diet, and moving more, my a1c at 8 months is now 5.4, in the normal range.

        "body": "Hi, I\u2019m on my fifth week, ummm sixth. My H-A1C was 9.2 and terribly uncontrolled with the smallest amount of food eaten. I\u2019ve had type 2 for over twenty years. It seems everything seems to be great then, my diabetes changes and all is bad. I\u2019m fortunate enough to be prescribed Libre when it first arrived and now Libre 3. Currently, I\u2019ve lowered to 7.6. This is a wonderful glp1 but you have to put in the work. Listen to podcasts, read blogs and realize this isn\u2019t something you take and forget. Change your eating habits, snack a lot and drink stuff with electrolytes. Liquids will keep away the sickness as long as you stay away from fried, everything. Walk every day and lift weights two times a week or something heavy, for muscle loss. Most important educate and change your eating habits.",
